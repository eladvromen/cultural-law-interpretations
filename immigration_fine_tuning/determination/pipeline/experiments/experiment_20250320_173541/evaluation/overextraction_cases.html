1 REASONS FOR DECISION  
 
[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX  (the “Appellant ”) appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection 
Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection. The Appellant has submitted new 
evidence in support of her appeal and she has requested an oral hearing. The Appellant further  
requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the determination of the RPD and find 
that she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Alternatively, the Appellant 
requests that the matter be remitted to the RPD for reconsider ation by a differently -constituted 
panel.

the appeal was dismissed on April 11, 2016. The Appellant subsequently appealed to the Federal 
Court and her appeal was allowed  on July 11, 2016, and remitted to the RAD.

RAD confirms the determination o...</div>

permanent resident status. Section  28 of the Act indicates that a permanent resident must 
be present in Canada for 730 days over a five -year  period.

 REASONS FOR DECISION  
[1] XXXXXXXXX  (the  principal  Appellant)  and his daughter XXXXXXXXX , citizen s of 
Ukraine , appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their  claim s for 
refugee protection. They  have not submitted new evidence in suppor t of their  appeal  but do 
request an oral hearing. The principal Appellant had been designated at the RPD hearing as a 
designated representative of the minor daughter. The RAD will maintain that designation for the 
sake of this appeal.  The Appellant s ask th e Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)  to overturn the 
decision of the RPD and to find that this Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of 
protection . In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the matter be returned to the RPD for a 
new heari ng under a differently constituted panel.

REASONS FOR DECISION  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
[1]      The Appellant appeals from the determination that he has failed to meet his 
residency obligation.  
[2]      Subject to certain exceptions that do not apply  in this case , subsection 28(2) of the 
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act  (Act)  requires that a permanent r esident be 
physically present in Canada for at least 730 days in any five -year period . 
[3]      It is conceded that the Appellant did not meet his residency requirement and that the 
decision under appeal is valid in fact and law. The issue on appeal is whether ther e are 
sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds that this appeal should be allowed.    
[4]      For the reasons that follow, this  appeal  is allowed
