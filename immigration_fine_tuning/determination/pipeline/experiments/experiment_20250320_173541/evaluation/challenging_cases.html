[1] XXXXXXXXX  (the principal claimant) and his wife XXXXXXXXX , citizens of Syria, claim 
refugee protection pursuant to Section s 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection

[3] The claimants have a son who has been granted refugee status in Canada.  In 2008 they 
attempted to come to Canada to visit that son, but were denied visitor visas since immigration 
officials were not convinced they would return to Syria.3  They were successful in obtaining vis itor 
visas in 2010, and arrived in Canada in XXXX  of that year.  The following month they filed claims 
for refugee protection.  They claim that they are of Kurdish ethnicity, and that their two politically -
active sons were persecuted by the authorities bef ore fleeing the country.  The intelligence service 
allegedly detained and abused the principal claimant because they sought his sons.  The claimants 
fear that, if returned to Syria, they will be harmed ...</div>

 REASONS FOR DECISION  
 
[1] These are my reasons and decision in the appeal of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (the 
“appellan t”). The appeal is from a refusal to approve the permanent resident visa applications 
made by SylXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and JaXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  (the “applicants”) who 
were sponsored by the appellant. Those are the appellant's biological parents.  
 
[2] The abili ty to sponsor family members is permitted by sections 12 and 13 of the 
Immigra tion and Refugee Protection Act (the “ Act ”).1 Eligibility to sponsor requires 
demonstration of income at, or above,  income levels that are set by the Immigration and Refugee 
Prot ection R egulation s (the “ Regulations ”).2  
 
[3] This application was refused based on an assessment of income from December 2012, to 
December 2013, for five persons. At that time, the sponsor had to show income at, or above, the 
levels estab...</div>
