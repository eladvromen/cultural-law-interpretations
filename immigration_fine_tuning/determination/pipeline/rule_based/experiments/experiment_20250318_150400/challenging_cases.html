Oral Reasons for Decision

[1] This is the decision in the appeal by [REDACTED] (the appellant) from a deportation order made against him on November 16, 2000 following his conviction for trafficking narcotics on April 26, 1996 where he received a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment. [2] This deportation order was stayed by the Immigrat ion Appeal Division’s Member [REDACTED] on December 10, 2001. At that time, following a recommendation by the Minister’s counsel and taking into account different humanitarian and compassionate factors, Member [REDACTED] concluded that such a stay was warranted. I will quote from th e Member’s decision on page 2.

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are my reasons and decision in the appeal of [REDACTED] (the

“appellan t”). The appeal is from a refusal to approve the permanent resident visa applications

made by Syl[REDACTED] and Ja[REDACTED] (the “applicants”) who

were sponsored by the appellant. Those are the appellant's biological parents.



[2] The abili ty to sponsor family members is permitted by sections 12 and 13 of the

Immigra tion and Refugee Protection Act (the “ Act ”).1 Eligibility to sponsor requires

demonstration of income at, or above, income levels that are set by the Immigration and Refugee

Prot ection R egulation s (the “ Regulations ”).2



[3] This application was refused based on an assessment of income from December 2012, to

December 2013, for five persons. At that time, the sponsor had to show income at, or above, the

levels established by regulation , which for five persons was $46,850.
