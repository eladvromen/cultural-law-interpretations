TA4-16824 These are the reasons for the negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) with respect to the claim of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the claimant), a 23-year-old citizen of Mexico.

1 The hearing for this claim was held pursuant to subsection 170(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

2 (IRPA). The claimant alleged that he has a well-found ed fear of persecution if he were to return to Mexico by reason of his sexual orientation. In addition, he claims to be a person in need of protection by reason of either, a danger of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture or to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. ISSUES AND DETERMINATION

The determinative issue in this claim is whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico by reason of a Convention ground, including whether the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection. Having considered the totality of the evid ence, the panel finds that the claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state prot ection and is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

TA4-04286 These are the reasons for the negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) with respect to the claim of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the claimant), a 24-year-old citizen of Poland.

1 The hearing for this claim was held pursuant to subsection 170(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

2 (IRPA). The claimant alleged that she has a well-found ed fear of persecution if she were to return to Poland by reason of her membership in a particular social group, that is, a person who has been targeted by family member s because of her desire to marry a man of another faith. In addition, she claims to be a person in need of protection by reason of either a danger of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture or to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. At the hearing, the claimant’s husband [REDACTED] was called as a witness in support of the claimant. ISSUES AND DETERMINATION

The determinative issue in this claim is whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Poland by reason of a Convention ground including whether the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.



1 Exhibit R/A-2, information provided by Citizensh ip and Immigration Canada (CIC), certified true copy of the claimant’s Polish passport.

These are the reasons with respect to the claim made by [REDACTED] [REDACTED] to be a Convention refugee and a person in need of protection. The claimant is a 42-year-old married, male citizen of the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as China). The claimant fears returning to China due to his involvement in an underground Christian church. Allegations The claimant was a long distance truck dr iver in China. In mid- [REDACTED] 2004, the claimant’s partner and he transported goods to [REDACTED] at night. When they were on a slope he could not slow down the truck because something went wrong with the brakes. The claimant was in a panic and at this crucial time his partner murmured, which he could hear clearly. The claimant was angry with him because he seemed not to worry as he tried his best to stop the truck, and finall y he turned the wheel to the rock close to the hill and the truck stopped. After the truck stopped, the claimant’s pa rtner said, “Thank God.” The claimant was very curious why he did not worry and hi s partner told him that he was praying to God for help and God protected them. He also said that he was a Christian and talked to the claimant about God, who is almighty. When they were off work, his friend, [REDACTED], came to him and talked to him about his religion and God’s love, as well as some stories about [REDACTED]. Th...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] The appellant, [REDACTED], appeals from the refusal to grant a permanent resident

visa to his mother [REDACTED] (the applicant) from Vietnam. The applicant was denied a

visa because a visa officer at the High Commission of Canada in Singapore determined that her

sponsor, the appellant, did not have sufficient income to satisfy the Minimum Necessary Income

(MNI) under section 133(1)(j)(i) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (the

Regulations ).



[2] The appellant is a citizen of Canada who became permanent resident of Canada in April

1990. The appellant was born in Vietnam in 1961 and when he was six years old his father died

and it was left to his mother, the applicant, to raise him and his two older sisters. The appellant

testified at his hearing on May 31, 2013 that he had the best mother, who laboured in the rice

fields, but despite her efforts the family was very poor. The appe llant testified that in 1986 he

was separated from his family when he, along with others, fled the hardship in Vietnam for the

relative security of life in Cambodia a...</div>

Reasons for Decision



INTRODUCTION



[1] These are the reasons for the decision of an Oral Reconsideration of a two -year stay of

removal granted to Mort[REDACTED] (the appellant) by Immigration Appeal

Division (IAD) Member [REDACTED]. The stay of removal was extended a further three -

year term by Member [REDACTED] on December 19, 2008 . The stay of removal was also

reviewed and continued by Member [REDACTED] on July 28, 2010.



[2] This oral review comes as a result of an application made by the Canadian Border

Services Agency (CBSA) on the basis that the appellan t had breached his stay, by not havin g

complied with conditions [11 ] and [16] of his stay of removal. Condition [11] required the

appellant to attend an alcohol rehabilitation program at the Scarborough Hospital Community

Mental Health Addiction Program or Alcoholics Anonymous and provide written evidence of

enrolment and attendance by December 17, 2010. Condition [16] required the appellant to pay

back any outstanding fines or at least provide evidence of payments being made pursuant to a

payment agreement.

Reasons for Decision

[1] [REDACTED] (the “primary appellant ”), and her daughter [REDACTED] (cumulatively, the “appellants”) appeal the removal orders made against them on August 16, 2005 by Minister’s Delegate [REDACTED] in Cana da that they each have individually not complied with the residency obligati on as articulated in section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the “Act”).

1 [2] The primary appellant, on behalf of both appell ants, does not challenge the legal validity of the removal order on their residency obligations, but seeks discretionary relief on their appeal, pursuant to subsection 63(4) of the Act. Each appellant thus bears an onus of establishing that, taking into account the best interests of a child or children directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations exist which warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case. [3] Both appellants testified at the appeal. [REDACTED], also referred to as [REDACTED], 16 years of age at hearing and still a minor, testified first solely in English. The primary app...</div>

Oral Reasons for Decision

Introduction [1] These are the reasons in the appeal, pursuan t to subsection 63(4) of the Immigration and

Refugee Protection Act (IRPA ) of Vama[REDACTED] (the appellant). He is appealing the visa officer’s determination that he is in breach of his residency obligation. [2] On March 10, 2005, a visa officer determined that the appellant had failed to comply with the residency obligations set out in section 28 of IRPA

. As a result, the appellant was found to be inadmissible to Canada pursuant to subsection 41(b) of IRPA

. The officer also found that the appellant had not satisfied the requirement s of paragraphs 31(3)(a) and (b) of IRPA

, and therefore, his application for a travel document was refused. [3] Specifically, the appellant had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five years preceding the date of his application, that is, from March 10, 2000 to March 10, 2005. The officer was also not satisfied, pursu ant to paragraph 28(2)(c) of IRPA,
