[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the claimant) is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Communist regime and in particular, the Public Security Bureau, by reason of his political opinion as a Falun Gong practitioner. In addition, he claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a dange r of torture in the People's Republic of China. ALLEGATIONS: The claimant alleges that he started to practice Falun Gong in [REDACTED] 2003 in order to improve his health.

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] This is an appeal of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the

Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) rejecting the claims of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

(hereinafter referred to by her first name, [REDACTED] ), and her two minor children , [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (each respectively born in 2014 and 2017 in the United States

of America —the U.S.A. and hereinafter respectively referred to by their first names [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] ). The RPD rejected the claims of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] for reasons relating to their birth in

the U.S.A. and rejected the claim of [REDACTED] for the existence of an internal flight alternative

(IFA) in Lagos, Nigeria .

[2] The Appellants claimed refugee protection from Canada pursuant to the Immigration

Refugee Protect ion Act (IRPA)1 based on an alleged fear of violence and the threat of death from

[REDACTED] ex-husband and the alleged agent of persecution, [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (hereinafter “ [REDACTED] ”),

if they return to Nigeria. [REDACTED] is not the father of [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] .

[3] The RPD stated that the determinative issues of [REDACTED] claim were her credibility

concerning any forward -looking risk, whether she rebutted the presumption of State Protection

and the availability of an IFA in Lagos.

DECISION

[4] For the reasons provided below, the RAD finds that the RPD’s decision was correct with

respect to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] but was incorrect with respect to [REDACTED] . The RAD grants [REDACTED]

appeal but agrees with the correct decision of the RPD and rejects the a ppeals of [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] .

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the Appellant) is a citizen of Saint Lucia. She appeals a decision of the

Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection. The Appellant asks

the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to set aside the decision of the RPD, and find the Appellant

to be a Convention refugee, or in the alternative, refer the claim back to the RPD for

redetermination. The Appellant asks for a hearing to deal with the documentation presented in the

Memorandum of Appeal. No new evidence was presented in the Me morandum of Appeal.

DETERMINATION

[2] Pursuant to ss. 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD

confirms the determination of the RPD and dismisses the appeal.

Background

[3] The Appellant was raised by her stepmother, and does not ha ve any knowledge of her

biological mother. The Appellant discovered during her teenage years that she was more attracted

to girls than boys. As a result of the homophobic attitudes in Saint Lucia, the [REDACTED] became

withdrawn and unhappy emotionally. The Appellant discovered a girl in the school who felt the

same way, and began a nonsexual relationship. After the relationship became more physical, they

were discovered by other students who made life a torment at school. Both she and her friend

dropped out of secondary school in [REDACTED] 1997. The Appellant ’s father and stepmother tried to

convince her to go back to school in another location, but she refused, and ran away from home.

While living on the streets, a man befriended her, took her into his home, and she became

sexually active with him. After the birth of a daughter on [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , 2000, the relationship

ended, but she continued to live with this man in a nonsexual relationship, all the time seeing her

girlfriend from high school. At the Appellant ’s wor kplace, she and her girlfriend were discovered

Reasons for Decision



[1] On May 8, 2008 Member [REDACTED] of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) granted Or[REDACTED] (the appellant) a stay (on conditions) of the deportation order issued against him on May 7, 2007. The stay was gr anted to the appellant based on the written recommendation of the respondent. The duration of the stay was for one year and it included 12 conditions. [2] On February 25, 2010 Member [REDACTED] of the IAD extended the stay for another six months because the appellant did not obtain his passport. Minister’s counsel at that time consented to the extension of the stay in order to allow the appellant to obtain his passport. [3] On November 2, 2010 the stay was further extended. On December 9, 2010 the appellant was sent a Notice of Reconsideration and on March 7, 2011 the Minister submitted a written statement indicating that the appellant had not complied with his stay and pointed to further criminality, his failure to obtain a passport and his failure to provide a Statement of Compliance. [4] At today’s hearing the appellant appeared without counsel. The Panel entered into evidence documents submitted by the Minister.

1 Minister’s counsel submitted in writing the following:

… you [the appellant] were granted a stay of your deportation order by the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board. As you were convicted of serious criminality since, your stay is now cancelled by operation of law. Your appeal is terminated. Section 68 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states as follows: 68. (1) To stay a removal order, the Immigration Appeal Division must be satisfied, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, that sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.

[REDACTED], the principal claimant, is a citizen of Venezuela and claims refugee protection pursuant to ss.96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. [REDACTED], the minor claimant, is the son of the principal claimant and also a citizen of Venezuela. He also claims refugee protection pursuant to ss.96 and 97 of the Act basing his claim on the claim of his mother. The principal claimant is the designate d representative of the minor claimant. ALLEGATIONS The principal claimant alleged that she came to Canada to seek protection because she was constantly harassed by one [REDACTED] XX who was her friend in Venezuela and that the said friend threatened her life. She alleged that the threats were the result of her refusing the sexual advances of [REDACTED] who is a lesbian. DETERMINATION I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as she does not have a well- founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Venezuela. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to Venezuela would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Venezuela will subject her personally to a danger of torture. I find that the minor claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection for the same reasons as his mother as his claim depended on the circumstances of his mother.

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , (the principal claimant), [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , (the female

claimant), and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , (minor claimant), seek protection in Canada pursuant to

sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 They allege a

well -founded fear of persecution in Pakistan from Tehrik -i-Taliban.

[2] Pursuant to Rule 55(1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules,2 these claims have been

joined. The Refugee Protection Division (the RPD) has designated [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] the

representative for the minor claimant, pursuant to IRPA section 167(2).

ALLEGATIONS

[3] The claimants allege that they meet the definition of Convention refugee, in that they are

“persons who by reason of a well -founded fear of persecution for reasons of their nationality and

membership in a particular social group are outside their country of nationality and are unable,

by reason of that fear, or are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that county”,

namely Pakistan. In the alternative, they allege they are persons in need of protection. Their fear

stems from the attempts of Tehrik -i-Taliban (Taliban) to recruit the principal claimant. A

summary of their allegations f ollows:

 The principal claimant comes from [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] , a small village in

[REDACTED] , which is in the Khyber -Pakhtunkhwa (KP) region of Pakistan.

 In [REDACTED] 2008, the Taliban attempted to recruit him into its ranks. He told

them he was not interested, but they i nsisted that he meet with them at a

certain “checkpoint”. When he failed to show up, three men went to the

family home to look for him. His father advised him to go into hiding,

which he did. He principal claimant went to the village of [REDACTED] , where

he foun d work as a [REDACTED] . He lost his job when men came ...</div>
