Section 28 of the Act indicates that a permanent resident must\n\nbe present in Canada for 730 days over a five -year period.\n\n[2] According to the evidence on record, including the officer\u2019s\n\ndecision,2 document A -1,3 and the appellant\u2019s testimony, he allegedly spent\n\napproximately 200 days in Cana da before the removal order was issued against him. The\n\nappellant is not contesting the legal validity of the immigration officer\u2019s decision.\n\n[3] This appeal was heard by two different members on the following\n\ndates: January 27, 2015, and January 11, 2016.4 Given the considerable evidence in this\n\ncase, the parties agreed that it is in the best interests of those involved i n this case to\n\ncontinue with a new member after Member [REDACTED] left the Immigration Appeal\n\nDivision (IAD). In addition, it is important to note that during the hearing on January 27,\n\n2015, there was the possibility that a second reason would be added by t he Minister\u2019s\n\nrepresentative; however, she indicated at the beginning of the hearing on January 11,\n\n2016, that she would not be invoking a second reason for refusal, and it should therefore\n\nnot be taken into consideration by the panel in this case.\n\n\n\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C.

As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.\n\n[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate ( H&C ) considerations\n\nwarrant special relief in the Appellant\u2019s case.4 I find that they do. The appeal is allowed.\n\n[4] In 1994, the [REDACTED] landed in Canada with her spouse and their two children.5 Their\n\nson stayed in Canada with the [REDACTED]\u2019s brother. The Appellant, her spouse, and t heir daughter\n\nreturned to Hong Kong. They intended to settle permanently in Canada in 1995 or 1996 after\n\nwinding up her spouse\u2019s business in Hong Kong. The Appellant, her spouse, and their daughter\n\nreturned to Canada in 1995 to visit their son. The [REDACTED] nt\u2019s spouse experienced health concerns\n\nduring those long -haul flights. Consequently, he refused to travel anywhere after 1995. The\n\nAppellant stayed in Hong Kong with her spouse because she felt this was her role as \u201ca traditional\n\nChinese wife.\u201d She travel ed to Canada regularly until 2013 on her own. After 2013, her spouse\u2019s\n\nhealth deteriorated, and she could no longer leave him to travel to Canada. He died in Hong Kong\n\nin September 2018. In April 2019, the [REDACTED]\u2019s daughter had surgery in Hong Kong . In mid -\n\n2019, the [REDACTED]\u2019s son learned that the Appellant could apply for a PR travel document.

The issue on appeal is whether ther e are\n\nsufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds that this appeal should be allowed.\n\n[4] For the reasons that follow, this appeal is allowed\n\nEVIDENCE\n\n[5] The Appellant was present in person and testified at the hearing before me.\n\n[6] In the five years en ding August 8 , 2018, the Appellant has been physically present in\n\nCanada for 413 of the 730 days that are required by the residency obligation . The Appellant has\n\nsatisfied approximately 57% of the two -year requirement.\n\n[7] The Appellant is married. He and his wife have a daughter who is now 13 years old.\n\nHis wife is a permanent resident. His daughter was born in Canada and is a Canadian citizen.\n\n[8] The Appellant became a permanent resident in 2001 under a skilled worker program.\n\nHe came from Shanghai, China. He f irst lived in Toronto for several months and then moved\n\nto Montreal. From 2002 to 2004, the Appellant studied business as a graduate student at\n\nMcGill. He earned his Masters of Business Administration in 2004.\n\n[9] The [REDACTED]\u2019s wife first became a permanent resident of Canada in 2004.

You are a citizen of Algeria and a permanent\n\nresident of Canada.\n\n[2] Permanent residents of Canada must comply with a residency obligation. One of the ways\n\nto comply with it is to have spent a sufficient number of days in Canada.\n\n[3] To be able to enter Canada, you applied for a permanent resident travel document. This\n\napplication was received by the Canadian immigration authorities on August 8, 2019 . An\n\nimmigration officer refused this application because he concluded that you had not complied with\n\nyour residency obligation. This is the decision being appealed before me. Your appeal is based on\n\nsubsection 63(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protectio n Act , which I will refer to simply as the\n\nAct.\n\n[4] You admit that you did not comply with your residency obligation. However, you are\n\nasking that you r appeal be allowed based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The\n\nMinister\u2019s representative is request ing that your appeal be dismissed.\n\n[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities, requiring that\n\nallegations are more likely than not to be true .\n\n[6] I conclude that you failed to comply with your residency obligation. I also conclude that\n\nthere are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations. I will refer to\n\nparagraph 67(1)(c) of the Act. This paragraph states that an appeal is allowed if, taking into\n\naccount the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and\n\ncompassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.\n\n[7] Given that I conclude that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate\n\nconsiderations, the appeal is d ismissed.\n\n\n\n2021 CanLII 81259..."

As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.\n\n[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate (H &C)\n\nconsiderations warrant special relief in all the circumstances of the Appellant\u2019s case.4\n\n[4] I find that the Appellant\u2019s reasons for staying outside of Canada, his return to Canada at\n\nthe first opportunity, his establishment in Canada, his family ties to and support from his family\n\nin Canada, the hardship he and his family members in Canada would suffer if he were removed\n\nfrom Canada, the best interests of his minor children , and Canada\u2019s immigration objectives are\n\nsufficient H&C considerations to warrant allowing this appeal. In coming to this decision, I\n\nacknowledge the Appellant\u2019s significant shortfall in meeting the residency obligation.\n\n[5] The reasons below explain why this appeal is allowed.\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n[6] The Appellant is a 39-year -old Pakistani citizen who became a PR as a dependent on his\n\nspouse\u2019s skilled worker application .5 He landed as a PR with his spouse and their daughters on\n\nOctober 16, 2014. The Appellant and his family left Canada on November 21 or 22, 2014.\n\n[7] On Octob er 17, 2019, the Appellant\u2019s spouse and daughters returned to Canada for the\n\nfirst time since November 2014.6 The officer who examined them took no enforcement action,7\n\nand there is no evidence before me that their PR status is now in jeopardy.8\n\n[8] On November 6, 2019, the Appellant returned t..."

The departure orders were based on findings that the appellants were permanent residents who had not complied with their conditions of landing. [2] The appellants appealed to the Immigra tion Appeal Division (IAD). They did not challenge the legal validity of the departure orders made against them. The departure orders are valid in law. [3] The appellants based their appeals on the humanitarian and compassionate grounds for special relief set out in s. 67(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\n\n(IRPA ). [4] The principal appellant testified at the admissibility hearing before the Immigration Division. He did not testify at the IAD appeal hearing. [5] The principal appellant\u2019s daughter, [REDACTED] (Tina), testified at the IAD hearing. So did her mother, [REDACTED], as well as her brother [REDACTED]. An Exhibit Book of disclosure materials was also filed. [6] The appellant\u2019s counsel submitted that an independent humanitarian and compassionate assessment be conducted by the panel for each of the four appellants. The appellant\u2019s counsel, in his submissions, focussed on the humanitarian and compassionate considerations established that warrant the granting of special relief with respect to the appellants [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. While not abandoning their claims for special relief, the appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged some of the weaknesses in the cases for special relief presented by the appellants [REDACTED] and his son [REDACTED].\n\n2009 CanLII 36245 (CA IRB)\n\nIAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAI: Client ID No. / N\n\no ID client:\n\n2\n\n[7] The Min..."

The appellant applied for a permanent resident travel\n\ndocument (\u201cPRTD\u201d) on February 28, 2018 in Bengaluru. His application was refused on March\n\n28, 2018, as he did not meet the requirements of secti on 28 of the Immigration and Refugee\n\nProtection Act1 (hereinafter \u201cthe Act \u201d).

He immigrated with\n\nhis wife and his dependant son. The appellant stayed i n Canada just over one week after\n\nbecoming a permanent resident. He says he could not find employment as a geological engineer\n\nbecause of his poor English language skills and had to return to China to look after his elderly\n\nfather. His wife and son stayed in Canada. When it was time to renew his permanent resident\n\ncard the appellant knew he only spent 150 days in Canada in the preceding five years. He also\n\nknew he would not meet his residency obligations. He hired an immigration consultant by the\n\nname of [REDACTED] to renew his permanent resident card. In hiring Mr. [REDACTED], the\n\nappellant became a participant in a large -scale immigration fraud aimed at obtaining permanent\n\nresident cards for permanent residents of Canada who did not spend the required period in\n\nCanada. Mr. [REDACTED] came to the attention of Canadian immigration authorities in 2012 when his\n\ntravel documents were found in the offices of Mr. [REDACTED] and New Can Consultants (Canada)\n\nLtd. \u201cNew Can Consultants\u201d during the execution of a search warrant during th e criminal\n\ninvestigation of Mr. [REDACTED].\n\n\n\nThe Sunny Wang -New Can Consultants fraud:\n\n\n\n[2] [REDACTED] and New Can Consultants assisted clients with renewing their permanent\n\nresident card when they did not meet their residency obligation. The firm assisted clients in\n\nfraudulently obtaining their permanent residency status by altering passports or copies of\n\npassport to show that the clients were in Canada when they were not, falsifying employment\n\nrecords to show that the clients worked for a Canadian corporation when they did not and,\n\nmisrepresenting the residence of clients b..."

He was issued a removal order at\n\nMontr \u00e9al-Pierre Elliot Trudeau International Airport on June 13, 2019 because an officer\n\ndetermined that he did not meet the residency obligation of being physically present in Canada\n\nfor 730 days in any five -year period.1 The officer gave him credit for 81 days.2\n\n[2] At the time the removal order was issued, the Appellant had about eight months left for\n\nthe five -year period to elapse. He did not leave Canada after the removal order was issued. At\n\nthis appeal, he does not dispute the legal validity of officer\u2019s decision but asks that his appeal be\n\nallowed because sufficient humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds e xist to warrant\n\nallowing his appeal. The Minister opposes this outcome.\n\n[3] The Appellant being burdened with the responsibility of supporting his family financially\n\nfrom when he was a minor is a unique and special circumstance in this appeal. This\n\nresponsibil ity impacted his ability to remain in Canada after he obtained PR status. He also\n\nprovided a reasonable reason for his extended stay abroad. His establishment in Canada is\n\nsignificant when compared to his establishment abroad and there is hardship to him i f he uproots\n\nhimself and returns to Peru. These all amount to sufficient H &C grounds to warrant granting\n\nspecial relief to him.\n\n[4] The appeal is allowed.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[5] In assessing H&C considerations, I am guided by various factors that have been set out\n\nin case law.3 The factors include the level of non -compliance, the reason for leaving and\n\nextended stay outside of Canada, ties to Canada, and establishment in Canada..."

I do not agree.\n\n[4] I find that neither the Appellant nor the Applicant provide a credible account about when,\n\nwhere, or how they first met, or about how their relationship developed from 2005 (or earlier) to\n\nthe point of marriage more than 10 years later in 2016. With each witness, more unresolved\n\ninconsistencies arose. As well, there is little in the way of documentary evidence to corroborate a\n\nrelationship before their marriage in 2016. Though there are elements of genuineness in this\n\nrelationship, and I acknowledge the Appellant\u2019s visits from Canada to China since 2010, the\n\nprovision of financial support, and the Appellant and Applicant demonstrating some knowledge\n\nof one another, I find that material inconsistencies and unexplained g aps in evidence about how\n\nthis relationship began and developed as well as other material inconsistencies and unexplained\n\ngaps in evidence tips the balance of probabilities against genuineness. For these reasons, I find it\n\nmore likely than not that this ma rriage is not genuine. The appeal is dismissed.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[5] The Appellant is a 60 -year -old Chinese citizen who has spent considerable amounts of\n\ntime in Canada since 2010, and who landed as a PR in February 2015, having been sponsored by\n\nhis older son.4 The Applicant is a 48 -yea..."
