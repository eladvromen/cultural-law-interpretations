REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] These are the reasons for decision in the appeal filed by [REDACTED]the appellant), a citizen of Lebanon, pursuant to subsection 63(3) of the

Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (the Act) against the removal order issued

against him on April 16, 2011, for failure to comply with the residency obligation set out

in section 28 of the Act and because there are in sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations to warrant special relief and justify the retention of his

permanent resident status. Section 28 of the Act indicates that a permanent resident must

be present in Canada for 730 days over a five -year period.

[2] According to the evidence on record, including the officer’s

decision,2 document A -1,3 and the appellant’s testimony, he allegedly spent

approximately 200 days in Cana da before the removal order was issued against him. The

appellant is not contesting the legal validity of the immigration officer’s decision.

[3] This appeal was heard by two different members on the following

dates: January 27, 2015, and January 11, 2016.4 Given the considerable evidence in this

case, the parties agreed that it is in the best interests of those involved i n this case to

continue with a new member after Member [REDACTED] left the Immigration Appeal

Division (IAD). In addition, it is important to note that during the hearing on January 27,

2015, there was the possibility that a second reason would be added by t he Minister’s

representative; however, she indicated at the beginning of the hearing on January 11,

2016, that she would not be invoking a second reason for refusal, and it should therefore

not be taken into consideration by the panel in this case.

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW



[1] The Appellant, [REDACTED], is a widowed 73 -year -old British national overseas and

a Chinese citizen who lives in Hong Kong.1 She appeal s a February 2021 decisio n that she did not

compl y with the residency obligation as a permanent resident (PR) .2

[2] To comply with the residency obligation, a PR must be physically present in Canada for

730 days in a five -year period.3 The Appellant concedes that she was present in Canada for zero

days in the relevant five -year period. As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.

[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate ( H&C ) considerations

warrant special relief in the Appellant’s case.4 I find that they do. The appeal is allowed.

[4] In 1994, the [REDACTED] landed in Canada with her spouse and their two children.5 Their

son stayed in Canada with the [REDACTED]’s brother. The Appellant, her spouse, and t heir daughter

returned to Hong Kong. They intended to settle permanently in Canada in 1995 or 1996 after

winding up her spouse’s business in Hong Kong. The Appellant, her spouse, and their daughter

returned to Canada in 1995 to visit their son. The [REDACTED] nt’s spouse experienced health concerns

during those long -haul flights. Consequently, he refused to travel anywhere after 1995. The

Appellant stayed in Hong Kong with her spouse because she felt this was her role as “a traditional

Chinese wife.” She travel ed to Canada regularly until 2013 on her own. After 2013, her spouse’s

health deteriorated, and she could no longer leave him to travel to Canada. He died in Hong Kong

in September 2018. In April 2019, the [REDACTED]’s daughter had surgery in Hong Kong . In mid -

2019, the [REDACTED]’s son learned that the Appellant could apply for a PR travel document. At

that time, a proposed extradition bill caused protests and di...</div>

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

[French version e dited for spelling, grammar and syntax]

OVERVIEW

[1] You, [REDACTED] , are the appellant. You are a citizen of Algeria and a permanent

resident of Canada.

[2] Permanent residents of Canada must comply with a residency obligation. One of the ways

to comply with it is to have spent a sufficient number of days in Canada.

[3] To be able to enter Canada, you applied for a permanent resident travel document. This

application was received by the Canadian immigration authorities on August 8, 2019 . An

immigration officer refused this application because he concluded that you had not complied with

your residency obligation. This is the decision being appealed before me. Your appeal is based on

subsection 63(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protectio n Act , which I will refer to simply as the

Act.

[4] You admit that you did not comply with your residency obligation. However, you are

asking that you r appeal be allowed based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The

Minister’s representative is request ing that your appeal be dismissed.

[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities, requiring that

allegations are more likely than not to be true .

[6] I conclude that you failed to comply with your residency obligation. I also conclude that

there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations. I will refer to

paragraph 67(1)(c) of the Act. This paragraph states that an appeal is allowed if, taking into

account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.

[7] Given that I conclude that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate

considerations, the appeal is d ismissed.

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellant , [REDACTED] , appeal s1 a Departure Order issued against him because

he did not compl y with the residency obligation as a permanent resident (PR).2

[2] To comply with the residency obligation, a PR must be physically present in Canada for

730 days in a five -year period.3 The Appellant conceded that he was physically present in

Canada for less than the required 730 days . As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.

[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate (H &C)

considerations warrant special relief in all the circumstances of the Appellant’s case.4

[4] I find that the Appellant’s reasons for staying outside of Canada, his return to Canada at

the first opportunity, his establishment in Canada, his family ties to and support from his family

in Canada, the hardship he and his family members in Canada would suffer if he were removed

from Canada, the best interests of his minor children , and Canada’s immigration objectives are

sufficient H&C considerations to warrant allowing this appeal. In coming to this decision, I

acknowledge the Appellant’s significant shortfall in meeting the residency obligation.

[5] The reasons below explain why this appeal is allowed.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

[6] The Appellant is a 39-year -old Pakistani citizen who became a PR as a dependent on his

spouse’s skilled worker application .5 He landed as a PR with his spouse and their daughters on

October 16, 2014. The Appellant and his family left Canada on November 21 or 22, 2014.

[7] On Octob er 17, 2019, the Appellant’s spouse and daughters returned to Canada for the

first time since November 2014.6 The officer who examined them took no enforcement action,7

and there is no evidence before me that their PR status is now in jeopardy.8

[8] On November 6, 2019, the Appellant returned t...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION

INTRODUCTION

[1] Rki[REDACTED] (the female appellant ) and [REDACTED] (the male

appellant ) are appealing against the decision of an immigration officer under subsection 63(3) of

the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (the Act ). In 2015, a Minister’ s delegate issued a

removal order against them for failing to comply with the residency obligation.

[2] In fact, under section 28 of the Act, a permanent resident must be in Canada for at least

730 days during the relevant five -year period. In this case, that is the five years after October 5,

2012.

ISSUE

[3] The appellant s acknowledge the non -compliance with the residency obligation in Canada

during the relevant period, and the panel does not note any er ror in law or fact in this regard .

Under paragraph 67(1) (c) of the Act, the appellants submit that there are sufficient humanitarian

and co mpassionate considerations to warrant special relief to retain their permanent residence.

The analysis of this point is based on the applicable case law .2 The appellants’ burden of proof is

the balance of probabilities.

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons for the decisio n in the appeal of [REDACTED] ( the

“appellant ”), from a removal order made against him on December 2, 2014 because of his failure

to comply with the residency obligation set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

(the “Act ”).1



[2] Section 28 of the Act requires a permanent resident to be physically present in Canada for

at least 730 days in the five -year period immediately prior to their application for a travel

document. The Minister’s delegate found that there were insufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected

by the decision, to justify the appellant’s retention of his permanent resident status overcoming

the breach of the residency obligation.



ISSUE



[3] The ap pellant challenges the legal validity of the removal order and also argues in the

alternative that the appeal should be allowed on the basis that sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstan ces of the case,

taking into account the best interests of any child directly affected by the decision.



DECISION



[4] I have come to the conclusion the removal order is valid in law. However, there are

sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds, in li ght of all the circumstances of the case,

taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, for me to find in

the appellant’s favour. Therefore , the appeal is allowed.

Reasons for Decision

[1] On July 24, 2007, departure orders were issued by an Immigration Division Member against the principal appellant, [REDACTED] his wife, [REDACTED]; his son [REDACTED]; and his daughter [REDACTED]. The departure orders were based on findings that the appellants were permanent residents who had not complied with their conditions of landing. [2] The appellants appealed to the Immigra tion Appeal Division (IAD). They did not challenge the legal validity of the departure orders made against them. The departure orders are valid in law. [3] The appellants based their appeals on the humanitarian and compassionate grounds for special relief set out in s. 67(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

(IRPA ). [4] The principal appellant testified at the admissibility hearing before the Immigration Division. He did not testify at the IAD appeal hearing. [5] The principal appellant’s daughter, [REDACTED] (Tina), testified at the IAD hearing. So did her mother, [REDACTED], as well as her brother [REDACTED]. An Exhibit Book of disclosure materials was also filed. [6] The appellant’s counsel submitted that an independent humanitarian and compassionate assessment be conducted by the panel for each of the four appellants. The appellant’s counsel, in his submissions, focussed on the humanitarian and compassionate considerations established that warrant the granting of special relief with respect to the appellants [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. While not abandoning their claims for special relief, the appellant’s counsel acknowledged some of the weaknesses in the cases for special relief presented by the appellants [REDACTED] and his son [REDACTED].

[18]  There are several humanitarian and compassionate factors which I can weigh in the

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] A permanent resident (“PR”) of Canada is required to be physically present in Canada for

at least 730 days in a five -year period, or fall into one of the exceptions permitted in the

legislation. Vi[REDACTED] (“the appellant”) is a 52 -year -old cit izen of India who

became a PR of Canada on June 26, 2000. The appellant applied for a permanent resident travel

document (“PRTD”) on February 28, 2018 in Bengaluru. His application was refused on March

28, 2018, as he did not meet the requirements of secti on 28 of the Immigration and Refugee

Protection Act1 (hereinafter “the Act ”). The visa officer noted that in the five -year period before

March 1, 2018 (“the period”), the appellant was physically present in Canada for zero days, and

indeed was last present in Canada in May 2006, more than 12 years ago. On May 7, 2018, the

appellant appealed the visa officer’s refusal to issue his PRTD and this is the decision in his

appeal.



HEARING

[2] At the hearing, the appellant was present over the telephone. He was questi oned

extensively by the panel. The Minister’s counsel provided submissions in writing and the

appellant and the panel considered these submissions in the examination of the appeal.

[3] I found the appellant to be a credible witness on a balance of probabiliti es and I accept

what he told me as truthful.

ISSUE

[4] The appellant conceded that the refusal by the visa officer was legally valid. Therefore,

the sole issue to be decided in this appeal is:

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] [REDACTED] (the appellant), a citizen of Algeria , is appealing the decision that she

failed to comply with the residency obligation under section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee

Protection Act1 (the Act ).

[2] The appellant is represented by counsel. I reviewed the documents submitted into

evidence by the appellant,2 the Minister’s Appeal Book and the additional documents from the

Minister,3 and I listened to the testimony from the three witnesses and the submissions from the

parties .

[3] Ms. [REDACTED] was born in Algeria in 1952 and landed in Canada in April 2007 with her

husband and children. She immigrated as a skilled worker and is a doctor. Her husband and her

children , born in 1982, 1985 and 1990 , have all become Canadian citizens .

[4] The appellant did not challenge the legal validity of the decision. An office r determined

in December 2015 that the appellant had failed to compl y with her residency obligation durin g

the relevant five -year period from December 2010 to December 2015 .

DETERMINATION

[5] In light of the evidence and the submissions, the panel determines that the officer’s

decision concerning the non -compliance with the residency obligation is valid in law, but that

there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to warrant special relief in

light of all the circumstances of the case.

old citizen of China who immigrated to Canad a in 2006 as a skilled worker. He immigrated with

his wife and his dependant son. The appellant stayed i n Canada just over one week after

becoming a permanent resident. He says he could not find employment as a geological engineer

because of his poor English language skills and had to return to China to look after his elderly

father. His wife and son stayed in Canada. When it was time to renew his permanent resident

card the appellant knew he only spent 150 days in Canada in the preceding five years. He also

knew he would not meet his residency obligations. He hired an immigration consultant by the

name of [REDACTED] to renew his permanent resident card. In hiring Mr. [REDACTED], the

appellant became a participant in a large -scale immigration fraud aimed at obtaining permanent

resident cards for permanent residents of Canada who did not spend the required period in

Canada. Mr. [REDACTED] came to the attention of Canadian immigration authorities in 2012 when his

travel documents were found in the offices of Mr. [REDACTED] and New Can Consultants (Canada)

Ltd. “New Can Consultants” during the execution of a search warrant during th e criminal

investigation of Mr. [REDACTED].



The Sunny Wang -New Can Consultants fraud:



[2] [REDACTED] and New Can Consultants assisted clients with renewing their permanent

resident card when they did not meet their residency obligation. The firm assisted clients in

fraudulently obtaining their permanent residency status by altering passports or copies of

passport to show that the clients were in Canada when they were not, falsifying employment

records to show that the clients worked for a Canadian corporation when they did not and,

misrepresenting the residence of clients b...</div>

INTRODUCTION REASONS FOR DECISION





[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal of Singh Mayank Sin[REDACTED]) from a negative determination made by a visa officer that the appellant did not

comply with the residency obligation prescribed in section 28 of the Immigration an d Refugee

Protection Act (Act ).1



[2] Section 28 of Act requires a permanent resident of Canada to be physically present in

Canada for at least 730 days in the five -year period immediately prior to their application for a

travel d ocument. The visa officer determined on June 4, 2015 that the Appellant was physically

present in Canada between 64 to 109 days in the five -year period preceding May 26, 2010, the

date his request for a travel document was received.2



[3] The appellant is not challenging the legal validity of the visa officer’s refusal and is

relying on the panel’s jurisdiction to grant special relief on humanitarian and compassionate

(H&C) grounds under section 67(1)( c) of the Act .3 The Minister appeared by written

submissions.



[4] After consideration of the appellant’s oral testimony and the documentary evidence, I

find sufficient H&C grounds to allow the appeal for the reasons that follow.

















1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.

2 Exhibit R -1, pp. 3 and 9.

3 Section 67(1)( c) of IRPA states:

67. (1) To allow an appeal, the Immigration Appeal Division must be satisfied that, at the time that

the appeal is disposed of, ...

(c) other than in the case of an appeal by the Minister, taking into account the best interests of a

child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations

warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.

appellant) , a citizen of Cameroon, who is appealing a decision made by the Immig ration Division

(ID) on January 19, 2016 .1 In th at decision, the Member conclude s as follows , with respect to the

appellant’s admissions of misrepresentation :

of appeal. I agree that the report is well -founded in light of the documentary evidence ,

C-1 to C -5, that has been submitted , as well as the admissions that were made in your

name .

[translated as it appears in the French version ]

[2] The appellant is not challenging the ID ’s decision but is asking that the panel take into

account the various humanitarian and compassionate considerations in this case. Considering this

and all the evidence, the panel concludes that the ID ’s decision is valid in law.

the panel is of the opinion that it is useful to provide a brief summary of the relevant facts in this

case, particularly with respect to misrepresentation.

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] Gonzalo Anto[REDACTED] (the Appellant), a 33-year -old citizen of Peru became

a permanent resident (PR) of Canada on February 19, 2015 after being sponsored by his brother

to Canada as a dependent in his father’s PR application . He was issued a removal order at

Montr éal-Pierre Elliot Trudeau International Airport on June 13, 2019 because an officer

determined that he did not meet the residency obligation of being physically present in Canada

for 730 days in any five -year period.1 The officer gave him credit for 81 days.2

[2] At the time the removal order was issued, the Appellant had about eight months left for

the five -year period to elapse. He did not leave Canada after the removal order was issued. At

this appeal, he does not dispute the legal validity of officer’s decision but asks that his appeal be

allowed because sufficient humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds e xist to warrant

allowing his appeal. The Minister opposes this outcome.

[3] The Appellant being burdened with the responsibility of supporting his family financially

from when he was a minor is a unique and special circumstance in this appeal. This

responsibil ity impacted his ability to remain in Canada after he obtained PR status. He also

provided a reasonable reason for his extended stay abroad. His establishment in Canada is

significant when compared to his establishment abroad and there is hardship to him i f he uproots

himself and returns to Peru. These all amount to sufficient H &C grounds to warrant granting

special relief to him.

[4] The appeal is allowed.

ANALYSIS

[5] In assessing H&C considerations, I am guided by various factors that have been set out

in case law.3 The factors include the level of non -compliance, the reason for leaving and

extended stay outside of Canada, ties to Canada, and establishment in Canada...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellant, [REDACTED] , appeals1 the refusal of the sponsorship of his spouse,

[REDACTED] , the Applicant.2

[2] The issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant demonstrates on a balance of

probabilities that this marriage is genuine and was not entered i nto primarily to acquire any

status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).3

[3] The Appellant submits that he and the Applicant are in a genuine marriage which was not

entered into primarily for the Applicant to obtain permanent resident (PR) status . I do not agree.

[4] I find that neither the Appellant nor the Applicant provide a credible account about when,

where, or how they first met, or about how their relationship developed from 2005 (or earlier) to

the point of marriage more than 10 years later in 2016. With each witness, more unresolved

inconsistencies arose. As well, there is little in the way of documentary evidence to corroborate a

relationship before their marriage in 2016. Though there are elements of genuineness in this

relationship, and I acknowledge the Appellant’s visits from Canada to China since 2010, the

provision of financial support, and the Appellant and Applicant demonstrating some knowledge

of one another, I find that material inconsistencies and unexplained g aps in evidence about how

this relationship began and developed as well as other material inconsistencies and unexplained

gaps in evidence tips the balance of probabilities against genuineness. For these reasons, I find it

more likely than not that this ma rriage is not genuine. The appeal is dismissed.

BACKGROUND

[5] The Appellant is a 60 -year -old Chinese citizen who has spent considerable amounts of

time in Canada since 2010, and who landed as a PR in February 2015, having been sponsored by

his older son.4 The Applicant is a 48 -yea...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] [REDACTED] (the appellant), a citizen of Morocco , is appealing against the

decision that he failed to comply with the residency obligation under section 28 of the

Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA ).

[2] The appellant was born in Morocco in 1967, and he was landed in Canada in 2004. The

appellant testified by telephone. I have reviewed his testimony as well as the documents filed by

the Minister’s representative2 and counsel for the appellant ,3 and I have considered the parties’

oral submissions.

[3] In light of the evidence and submissions, the panel concluded that the officer’ s decision

regarding the non -compliance with the residency obligation is valid in law and that, taking into

account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision , there a re insufficient

humanitarian and compassionate considerations to warrant special relief in light of all the

circumstances of the case.

[4] The appeal is dismissed .

Background

[5] The appellant became a permanent resident of Canada in 2004. He settled in Canada, go t

married, held jobs and lived in Canada from 2004 to 2010. In 2010, his father’s health

deteriorated. Since he was the only unmarried child, he returned to Morocco to live with his

parents and look after his father. After he left Canada in December 2010, the appellant spent

little time in Canada. There is significant non -compliance with his residency obligation. This is



1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended .

Reasons for Decision

[1] These are the motives in the decision concerning the appeal of Seyed[REDACTED] (the appellant), a citizen of Iran, pursuant to section 63(3) of the Immigration and Re fugee

Protection Act1 (the Act ), against the departure order made against him on the 13th of January 2012.



[2] On that day the visa officer found that the appellant was a person described at

paragraph 41( b) of the Act , a permanent resident who is inadmissib le in Canada for failing to

comply with the residency obligation prescribed in section 28 of the Act .



[3] Section 28 of the Act requires a permanent resident to be physically present in Canada for at

least 730 days during the five -year period immediately prec eding the date of the determination by

the visa officer of the permanent resident level of compliance with the requirements of the residency

obligation under the Act.



ISSUE

[4] The appellant did not challenge the validity of the departure order made by the vi sa officer.

Considering the fact that there is no evidence that the order is invalid, the tribunal concludes that the

departure order is valid in law.



[5] The appellant claimed that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds,

including the b est intere sts of the children that are directly affected to warrant the granting of

special relief in light of all the circumstances of this case, pursuant to paragraph 67(1)( c) of the Act .



[6] An appeal in front of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) is a De novo hearing, which

means that the role of the IAD is to evaluate all the evidence, evidence which was presented before

the visa officer as well as the new evidence provided and/or presented at the hearing on the 27th of

February 2014.
