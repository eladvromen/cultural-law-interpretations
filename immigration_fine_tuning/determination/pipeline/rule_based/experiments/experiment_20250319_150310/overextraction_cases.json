The Appellant has submitted new\n\nevidence in support of her appeal and she has requested an oral hearing. The Appellant further\n\nrequests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the determination of the RPD and find\n\nthat she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Alternatively, the Appellant\n\nrequests that the matter be remitted to the RPD for reconsider ation by a differently -constituted\n\npanel.\n\n[2] The RPD rejected this claim on February 4, 2016. The Appellant appealed to the RAD and\n\nthe appeal was dismissed on April 11, 2016. The Appellant subsequently appealed to the Federal\n\nCourt and her appeal was allowed on July 11, 2016, and remitted to the RAD.\n\nDetermination\n\n[3] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the\n\nRAD confirms the determination of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor\n\na person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\n\nBackground\n\n[4] The Appellant alleged in her Basis of Claim narrative (BOC) that she is a lesbian. She\n\npretended to be straight for years because being gay in Jamaica is dangerous. In [REDACTED] 2015 , she\n\nwas with a female friend in Montego Bay and she was seen by someone from her home town.\n\nWord spread and she was harassed and threatened. Her parents rejected her and she feared walking\n\nthe street. On April 2, 2015, she fled Jamaica and came to Canada.\n\n[5] The Appellant further alleged in her BOC that the police in Jamaica are as homophobic as\n\nthe public and she would place her life in danger by going to them. She fled Jamaica soon after she\n\nwas discovered to be gay.\n\n2017 CanLII 148756 (CA IRB)\n\nRAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TB6 -02584\n\n2 The I ssues\n\n[6] The panel indicated that ..."

Section 28 of the Act indicates that a permanent resident must\n\nbe present in Canada for 730 days over a five -year period.\n\n[2] According to the evidence on record, including the officer\u2019s\n\ndecision,2 document A -1,3 and the appellant\u2019s testimony, he allegedly spent\n\napproximately 200 days in Cana da before the removal order was issued against him. The\n\nappellant is not contesting the legal validity of the immigration officer\u2019s decision.\n\n[3] This appeal was heard by two different members on the following\n\ndates: January 27, 2015, and January 11, 2016.4 Given the considerable evidence in this\n\ncase, the parties agreed that it is in the best interests of those involved i n this case to\n\ncontinue with a new member after Member [REDACTED] left the Immigration Appeal\n\nDivision (IAD). In addition, it is important to note that during the hearing on January 27,\n\n2015, there was the possibility that a second reason would be added by t he Minister\u2019s\n\nrepresentative; however, she indicated at the beginning of the hearing on January 11,\n\n2016, that she would not be invoking a second reason for refusal, and it should therefore\n\nnot be taken into consideration by the panel in this case.\n\n\n\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C.

As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.\n\n[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate ( H&C ) considerations\n\nwarrant special relief in the Appellant\u2019s case.4 I find that they do. The appeal is allowed.\n\n[4] In 1994, the [REDACTED] landed in Canada with her spouse and their two children.5 Their\n\nson stayed in Canada with the [REDACTED]\u2019s brother. The Appellant, her spouse, and t heir daughter\n\nreturned to Hong Kong. They intended to settle permanently in Canada in 1995 or 1996 after\n\nwinding up her spouse\u2019s business in Hong Kong. The Appellant, her spouse, and their daughter\n\nreturned to Canada in 1995 to visit their son. The [REDACTED] nt\u2019s spouse experienced health concerns\n\nduring those long -haul flights. Consequently, he refused to travel anywhere after 1995. The\n\nAppellant stayed in Hong Kong with her spouse because she felt this was her role as \u201ca traditional\n\nChinese wife.\u201d She travel ed to Canada regularly until 2013 on her own. After 2013, her spouse\u2019s\n\nhealth deteriorated, and she could no longer leave him to travel to Canada. He died in Hong Kong\n\nin September 2018. In April 2019, the [REDACTED]\u2019s daughter had surgery in Hong Kong . In mid -\n\n2019, the [REDACTED]\u2019s son learned that the Appellant could apply for a PR travel document.

They have not submitted new evidence in suppor t of their appeal but do\n\nrequest an oral hearing. The principal Appellant had been designated at the RPD hearing as a\n\ndesignated representative of the minor daughter. The RAD will maintain that designation for the\n\nsake of this appeal. The Appellant s ask th e Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to overturn the\n\ndecision of the RPD and to find that this Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of\n\nprotection . In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the matter be returned to the RPD for a\n\nnew heari ng under a differently constituted panel.\n\nORAL HEARING\n\n[2] The Appellants have requested an oral hearing ; however , they have not disclosed any new\n\nevidence. Section 110 (6) of the IRPA allows the RAD to hold an oral hearing only if new\n\nevidence is disclosed in an appeal and if that new evidence :\n\n(a) raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of\n\nthe appeal;\n\n(b) is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and\n\n(c) if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n\n[3] As there is no new evidence , there can be no oral hearing before the RAD . The application\n\nfor an oral hearing is therefore dismissed.\n\nDETERMINATION - [REDACTED] [REDACTED]\n\n[4] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the\n\nRAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a\n\nperson in n eed of protection.

I agree that the report is well -founded in light of the documentary evidence ,\n\nC-1 to C -5, that has been submitted , as well as the admissions that were made in your\n\nname .\n\n[translated as it appears in the French version ]\n\n[2] The appellant is not challenging the ID \u2019s decision but is asking that the panel take into\n\naccount the various humanitarian and compassionate considerations in this case. Considering this\n\nand all the evidence, the panel concludes that the ID \u2019s decision is valid in law.\n\n[3] Before proceeding with the analysis of humanitarian and compassionate considerations ,\n\nthe panel is of the opinion that it is useful to provide a brief summary of the relevant facts in this\n\ncase, particularly with respect to misrepresentation.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[4] The appellant was born in Cameroon in 1982 . She pursued studies in management and\n\nobtained a master \u2019s degree in business administration. Her higher studies took place in\n\nCameroon and Belgium , where she lived temporarily for a few years. In May 2011, the appellant\n\nfiled an application to become a permanent resident in the \u201c skilled worker \u201d category. Her\n\napplication was accept ed and she arrived at Pierre Elliott Trudeau In ternational Airport with her\n\npermanent resident visa on December 6, 2012, prepared to complete the process of becoming a\n\npermanent resident of Canada. When applying for admission at the port of entry, the appe llant\n\nstated that she forgot to include her t..."

You are a citizen of Algeria and a permanent\n\nresident of Canada.\n\n[2] Permanent residents of Canada must comply with a residency obligation. One of the ways\n\nto comply with it is to have spent a sufficient number of days in Canada.\n\n[3] To be able to enter Canada, you applied for a permanent resident travel document. This\n\napplication was received by the Canadian immigration authorities on August 8, 2019 . An\n\nimmigration officer refused this application because he concluded that you had not complied with\n\nyour residency obligation. This is the decision being appealed before me. Your appeal is based on\n\nsubsection 63(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protectio n Act , which I will refer to simply as the\n\nAct.\n\n[4] You admit that you did not comply with your residency obligation. However, you are\n\nasking that you r appeal be allowed based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The\n\nMinister\u2019s representative is request ing that your appeal be dismissed.\n\n[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities, requiring that\n\nallegations are more likely than not to be true .\n\n[6] I conclude that you failed to comply with your residency obligation. I also conclude that\n\nthere are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations. I will refer to\n\nparagraph 67(1)(c) of the Act. This paragraph states that an appeal is allowed if, taking into\n\naccount the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and\n\ncompassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.\n\n[7] Given that I conclude that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate\n\nconsiderations, the appeal is d ismissed.\n\n\n\n2021 CanLII 81259..."

He stated that he intended to proceed alone.\n\n[4] I received the oral testimony of the appellant and of his spouse. There were no communication\n\ndifficulties.\n\n[5] At the end of the hearing, the appellant requested that his appeal be allowed for humanitarian and\n\ncompassionate considerations. The Minister is of the opinion that there are not sufficient humanitarian\n\nand compassionate considerations to warrant special relief.\n\n[6] In light of the documentary evidence, the testimonies and the positions of the parties, I determine\n\non a balance of probabilities that the removal order in this case is valid in law.\n\n[7] I also determine that there are sufficient humanitarian and compa ssionate considerations to\n\nwarrant special relief in light of the other circumstances of the case. Therefore, the appeal is allowed. I set\n\naside the departure order , and order that the appellant retain his permanent resident status for the reasons\n\nthat fol low.\n\n[8] The appellant arrived as a permanent resident on December 14, 2013. He returned to France, his\n\nprevious country of residence, to continue employment.\n\n[9] At the time of his interview on April 24, 2017, the appellant \u2019s permanent resident card had not\n\nyet expired, bu..."
