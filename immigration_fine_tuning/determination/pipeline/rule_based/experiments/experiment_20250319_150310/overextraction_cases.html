RAD F ile No. / N° de dossier de la SA R : TB7 -20771

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the “Principal Appellant”), [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] (the “Spousal Appellant”) and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the “Minor Appellant”) are

citizens of Nigeria and are appealing a dec ision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD)

denying their claims for refugee protection.

[2] The Minor Appellant is the daughter of the Principal Appellant and Spousal Appellant.

The Principal and Spousal Appellants also have a son named [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] , who was born in Canada and is a Canadian citizen and not an Appellant in this case . The

Principal Appellant was named as the Designated Representative (DR) of the Minor Appellant at

the RPD hearing and the RAD confirms this designation.

[3] The Appellan ts are requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the

RPD’s negative determination and find that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of

protection. In the alternative, the Appellants request that the RAD refer the matters back to the

RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.

RAD DETERMINATION

[4] In relation to the Minor Appellant, pursuant to s.111(1)( b) of the Immigration and Refugee

Protection Act (IRPA),1 the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and subs titutes its own

determination that the Minor Appellant is a Convention refugee. This appeal is allowed.

[5] In relation to the Principal and Spousal Appellants, the RAD dismisses the appeal and

confirms the decision of the RPD that the Principal and Spousal Ap pellants are neither

Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to s.111(1)( a) of the IRPA.2

1 REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the “Appellant ”) appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection

Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection. The Appellant has submitted new

evidence in support of her appeal and she has requested an oral hearing. The Appellant further

requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the determination of the RPD and find

that she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Alternatively, the Appellant

requests that the matter be remitted to the RPD for reconsider ation by a differently -constituted

panel.

[2] The RPD rejected this claim on February 4, 2016. The Appellant appealed to the RAD and

the appeal was dismissed on April 11, 2016. The Appellant subsequently appealed to the Federal

Court and her appeal was allowed on July 11, 2016, and remitted to the RAD.

Determination

[3] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the

RAD confirms the determination of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor

a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.

Background

[4] The Appellant alleged in her Basis of Claim narrative (BOC) that she is a lesbian. She

pretended to be straight for years because being gay in Jamaica is dangerous. In [REDACTED] 2015 , she

was with a female friend in Montego Bay and she was seen by someone from her home town.

Word spread and she was harassed and threatened. Her parents rejected her and she feared walking

the street. On April 2, 2015, she fled Jamaica and came to Canada.

[5] The Appellant further alleged in her BOC that the police in Jamaica are as homophobic as

the public and she would place her life in danger by going to them. She fled Jamaica soon after she

was discovered to be gay.

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] These are the reasons for decision in the appeal filed by [REDACTED]the appellant), a citizen of Lebanon, pursuant to subsection 63(3) of the

Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (the Act) against the removal order issued

against him on April 16, 2011, for failure to comply with the residency obligation set out

in section 28 of the Act and because there are in sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations to warrant special relief and justify the retention of his

permanent resident status. Section 28 of the Act indicates that a permanent resident must

be present in Canada for 730 days over a five -year period.

[2] According to the evidence on record, including the officer’s

decision,2 document A -1,3 and the appellant’s testimony, he allegedly spent

approximately 200 days in Cana da before the removal order was issued against him. The

appellant is not contesting the legal validity of the immigration officer’s decision.

[3] This appeal was heard by two different members on the following

dates: January 27, 2015, and January 11, 2016.4 Given the considerable evidence in this

case, the parties agreed that it is in the best interests of those involved i n this case to

continue with a new member after Member [REDACTED] left the Immigration Appeal

Division (IAD). In addition, it is important to note that during the hearing on January 27,

2015, there was the possibility that a second reason would be added by t he Minister’s

representative; however, she indicated at the beginning of the hearing on January 11,

2016, that she would not be invoking a second reason for refusal, and it should therefore

not be taken into consideration by the panel in this case.

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW



[1] The Appellant, [REDACTED], is a widowed 73 -year -old British national overseas and

a Chinese citizen who lives in Hong Kong.1 She appeal s a February 2021 decisio n that she did not

compl y with the residency obligation as a permanent resident (PR) .2

[2] To comply with the residency obligation, a PR must be physically present in Canada for

730 days in a five -year period.3 The Appellant concedes that she was present in Canada for zero

days in the relevant five -year period. As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.

[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate ( H&C ) considerations

warrant special relief in the Appellant’s case.4 I find that they do. The appeal is allowed.

[4] In 1994, the [REDACTED] landed in Canada with her spouse and their two children.5 Their

son stayed in Canada with the [REDACTED]’s brother. The Appellant, her spouse, and t heir daughter

returned to Hong Kong. They intended to settle permanently in Canada in 1995 or 1996 after

winding up her spouse’s business in Hong Kong. The Appellant, her spouse, and their daughter

returned to Canada in 1995 to visit their son. The [REDACTED] nt’s spouse experienced health concerns

during those long -haul flights. Consequently, he refused to travel anywhere after 1995. The

Appellant stayed in Hong Kong with her spouse because she felt this was her role as “a traditional

Chinese wife.” She travel ed to Canada regularly until 2013 on her own. After 2013, her spouse’s

health deteriorated, and she could no longer leave him to travel to Canada. He died in Hong Kong

in September 2018. In April 2019, the [REDACTED]’s daughter had surgery in Hong Kong . In mid -

2019, the [REDACTED]’s son learned that the Appellant could apply for a PR travel document. At

that time, a proposed extradition bill caused protests and di...</div>

RAD F ile No. / N° de dossier de la SA R :



REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] (the principal Appellant) and his daughter [REDACTED] , citizen s of

Ukraine , appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claim s for

refugee protection. They have not submitted new evidence in suppor t of their appeal but do

request an oral hearing. The principal Appellant had been designated at the RPD hearing as a

designated representative of the minor daughter. The RAD will maintain that designation for the

sake of this appeal. The Appellant s ask th e Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to overturn the

decision of the RPD and to find that this Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of

protection . In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the matter be returned to the RPD for a

new heari ng under a differently constituted panel.

ORAL HEARING

[2] The Appellants have requested an oral hearing ; however , they have not disclosed any new

evidence. Section 110 (6) of the IRPA allows the RAD to hold an oral hearing only if new

evidence is disclosed in an appeal and if that new evidence :

(a) raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of

the appeal;

(b) is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and

(c) if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.

[3] As there is no new evidence , there can be no oral hearing before the RAD . The application

for an oral hearing is therefore dismissed.

DETERMINATION - [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[4] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the

RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a

person in n eed of protection. This appeal is dismissed

REASONS FOR DECISION

INTRODUCTION

[1] [REDACTED] , the principal appellant , and her spouse , [REDACTED] , who are citizens

of Haiti , are appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated

November 21, 2017 , rejecting their refugee protection claim .

[2] They are ask ing the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to set aside the determination of the

RPD a nd recognize them as Convention refugees or as persons in need of protection or,

alternatively, to refer the matter to the RPD for re -determination by a differently constituted

panel .

[3] The appellants are not seeking to present new evidence and are not askin g that a hearing

be held in this appeal .

DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL

[4] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA ), the

RAD dismisses the appeal of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] and confirms the determination of the RPD,

namely, that he is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection .

[5] However, in the case of [REDACTED] , the appeal is allowed . The RAD sets aside the

determination of the RPD and substitutes the determination that, in its opinion, should have been

made, namely, that [REDACTED] [REDACTED] is a Convention refugee .

TH E R AD’S ROLE

[6] The role of the RAD is to review RPD decisions by applying the co rrectness standard of

review after carrying out its own analysis of the record in order to determine whether , as

submitted by the appellant, the RPD erred . The exception to this rule arises in situations where

the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility or weight to be given to the

RAD File No. / N° de dossier de la S AR :



REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] (the Appellant), a citizen of Ghana, appeals a decision of the Refugee

Protection Division (RPD) rejecting her claim for refugee protection.

[2] The Appellant submit ted documents to be considered as new evidence pursuant to

s.110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act or IRPA) in support of her

appeal. However, the Appellant did not request a hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division

(RAD) pursuant to section 1 10 (6) of the Act.

[3] The Appellant requests that the RAD set aside the RPD’s decision and remit the matter

back to the RPD for redetermination. In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the RAD grant

any other order that the Division deems reasona ble and expedient having regard to the peculiar

facts and circumstances of this case.

DETERMINATION

[4] Pursuant to Section 111(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the

RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neithe r a Convention refugee (CR)

nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.

[5] This appeal is dismissed.

Background:

[6] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that her husband’s famil y members want to carry

out female circumcision (female genital mutilation) on her infant daughter who was born in

Canada on [REDACTED], 2014. [REDACTED] and her husband oppose this practice. The Appellant is

afraid that she would personally face serious harm, torture or death due to her op posi tion to this

practice. The A ppellant’s husband remains in Ghana and he does not believe that he could protect

his wife or daughter in these circumstances. The Appellant also alleged that all female family

members of her husband have undergone this procedur e and her father -in-law in particular wishes

to preserve this custom .

RAD File No. / N° de dossier de la S AR :



REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] (the Appellant), a citizen of Pakistan, appeals a decision of the Refugee

Protect ion Division (RPD) rejecting her claim for refugee protection.

[2] The Appellant did not submit documents to be considered as new evidence pursuant t o

s.110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act or IRPA) , and t he Appellant did

not request a hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).

[3] The Appellant requests that the RAD set aside the RPD’s decision and accept her claim . In

the alternative, the Appellant requests that this claim be referred back to the RPD to be re -heard

by a differently constituted Panel.

DETERMINATION

[4] Pursuant to Section 111(a) of the Act , the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the

Appellant is neither a Convention refugee (CR) nor a person in need of protection pursuant to

sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act.

[5] This appeal is dismissed.

Background:

[6] The Appellant, a 76 year old widow , alleged before the RPD that her husband distributed

his assets amongst their six children (three live in Pakistan, two in Canada and one in the UK)

before he died. He also gave the Appellant two big houses . The Appellant was in Canada for five

months and returned to Pakistan in May 2013 . Upon her return to Pakistan , her children in

Pakistan pressured her to transfer her properties in their names o r else they will strangle her. She

is afraid to return to Pak istan because she fears that her children might kill her.

[7] Her claim was heard on October 23 , 2014 and the RPD, by a written decision, dated

Novem ber 13, 2014 rejected the claim and found that the Appellant is not credible and made up

her story to seek hea lth care in Canada.

RAD F ile No. / N° de dossier de la SA R :

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the Appellant), a citizen of Uganda, appeals a decision of the Refugee

Protection Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection. She has not submitted new

evidence and does not request an oral hearing. The Appellant asks the Refugee Appeal Divi sion

(RAD) to set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute a positive determination. In the

alternative, the Appellant asks that the matter be referred to the RPD for redetermination, giving

directions to the RPD to accept her claim.

DETERMINATIO N

[2] Pursuant to Section 111(1)(b) of IRPA, the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD

and substitutes its determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee. This appeal is

allowed.

Background

[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that, upon return to Uganda, she will be harmed by

her husband because she left him and he had abused her in the past.

[4] The Appellant’s claim for refugee protection was heard on December 16, 2014. By a

decision of January 8, 2015, the RPD rejected the claim. The RPD found that the Appellant has a

viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Kampala. The Appellant submits that the RPD’s

decision i s replete with errors of law and facts.

ANALYSIS

Role of the RAD

[5] What is the role of the RAD in considering an appeal against a decision of the RPD?

Although the Appellant makes no arguments with respect to the role of the RAD, the RAD notes ,

in [REDACTED] , the Court considered the appropriate relationship between the RAD and the RPD.1

RAD F ile No. / N° de dossier de la SA R :

It found that the RAD had erred in simply reviewing the RPD’s decision on a standard of

reasonableness, rather than conducting its own independent assessment of the Appellant ’s refugee

claim ...</div>

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

[French version e dited for spelling, grammar and syntax]

OVERVIEW

[1] You, [REDACTED] , are the appellant. You are a citizen of Algeria and a permanent

resident of Canada.

[2] Permanent residents of Canada must comply with a residency obligation. One of the ways

to comply with it is to have spent a sufficient number of days in Canada.

[3] To be able to enter Canada, you applied for a permanent resident travel document. This

application was received by the Canadian immigration authorities on August 8, 2019 . An

immigration officer refused this application because he concluded that you had not complied with

your residency obligation. This is the decision being appealed before me. Your appeal is based on

subsection 63(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protectio n Act , which I will refer to simply as the

Act.

[4] You admit that you did not comply with your residency obligation. However, you are

asking that you r appeal be allowed based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The

Minister’s representative is request ing that your appeal be dismissed.

[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities, requiring that

allegations are more likely than not to be true .

[6] I conclude that you failed to comply with your residency obligation. I also conclude that

there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations. I will refer to

paragraph 67(1)(c) of the Act. This paragraph states that an appeal is allowed if, taking into

account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.

[7] Given that I conclude that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate

considerations, the appeal is d ismissed.

Rea sons for Decision



Introduction

[1] The respondent makes an application that the appeal be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

The appeal is pursuant to sub section 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1

(IRPA ) of a removal order made against the appellant.

Decision

[2] Having considered the evidence and submissions, the panel finds that the appeal is

dismissed .

Background

[3] The Immigration Division issued a deportatio n order in September 2009 against the

appellant based on paragraph 36(1)( a) of the IRPA ,2 and the appellant appealed that order.

[4] In September 2012, the respondent made an application to dismiss the appeal for absence

of jurisdiction. On September 27, 2012, the appellant was requested to make any submissions;

none were received. This matter w as dealt with in chambers.

Analysis

[5] A person may be inadmissible based on serious criminality:3

36. (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of

serious criminality for

(a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament

punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, or of an

offence under an Act of Parliament for which a term of imprisonment of more than

six months has been imposed;

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] Karly[REDACTED], the appellant, a permanent resident and a citizen of the Republic of

Cameroon by birth, is appealing under subsection 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

from a departure order issued on April 24, 2017, by the Minis ter’s delegate at Pierre Elliott Trudeau

Airport in Montréal.

[2] The delegate noted that at the time of his port -of-entry interview, the appellant was unable to

meet the residency obligation under section 28 of the Act.

[3] During a hearing today, July 19, 2018, I reminded the appellant of his right, at his own expense,

to be represented by legal or other counsel. He stated that he intended to proceed alone.

[4] I received the oral testimony of the appellant and of his spouse. There were no communication

difficulties.

[5] At the end of the hearing, the appellant requested that his appeal be allowed for humanitarian and

compassionate considerations. The Minister is of the opinion that there are not sufficient humanitarian

and compassionate considerations to warrant special relief.

[6] In light of the documentary evidence, the testimonies and the positions of the parties, I determine

on a balance of probabilities that the removal order in this case is valid in law.

[7] I also determine that there are sufficient humanitarian and compa ssionate considerations to

warrant special relief in light of the other circumstances of the case. Therefore, the appeal is allowed. I set

aside the departure order , and order that the appellant retain his permanent resident status for the reasons

that fol low.

[8] The appellant arrived as a permanent resident on December 14, 2013. He returned to France, his

previous country of residence, to continue employment.

[9] At the time of his interview on April 24, 2017, the appellant ’s permanent resident card had not

yet expired, bu...</div>

RAD F ile No. / N° de dossier de la SA R :

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the Appellant) , a citizen of Somalia , appeals a decision of the

Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection. He has not

submitted new evidence in support of his appeal, nor does he request an oral hearing. The

Appellant asks the Refugee Ap peal Division (RAD) to overturn the decision of the RPD and to

find that th e Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. In the

alternative, the Appellant requests that the matter be returned to the RPD for a new hearing under

a di fferently constituted panel.

DETERMINATION

[2] Pursuant to Section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA or

“the Act” ), the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention

refugee nor a person in need of protection. This appeal is dismissed.

Background

[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he is a young male from the [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] clan and fears returning to Somalia because he will be persecuted by Al -Shabaab (forcibly

recruited or killed). Greater details may be found in the Appellant’s Basis of Claim (BOC) form1

and in the audio recording of the hearing.

[4] The Appellant’s application for refugee protection was heard on August 12 and 25, 2015.

A negative decision was rendered in writing on October 6, 2015. The RPD found that the

Appellant failed to provide sufficient credible evidence to substantiate the core of his claim

against Somalia.

[5] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred when the panel failed to deal clearly with the

risks faced by members of m inority clans when considering that government forces may be part

of the problem for those minorities. The Appellant submits that there is a nexus as he is a young

man of minority clan membership returning to Somalia after a lengthy absence that will be

2015 CanLII 105868 (CA IRB)

RAD F ile No. / N° de dossier de la SA R :

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (the Appellant) appeals a decision of

the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) accepting the claim for refugee protection of [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the Respondent ), a male from Nigeria. The Minister has submitted new evidence

in support of the appeal that was not presented at the RPD hearing.

DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL

[2] Pursuant to ss. 111 (1) (b) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA ), the

Refugee Appeal Division ( RAD ) sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes the

determination that [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] is neith er a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the

IRPA nor a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97 of IRPA. Pursuant to ss. 107(2) of

IRPA, the RAD finds that there is no credible basis for the claim and that it is manifestly

unfounded. This Appeal is allowed.

BACKGROUND

[3] The Respondent, [REDACTED] , alleged before the RPD that he is a gay man and

was involved in a sexual relationship with another man. The Respondent in the Addendum to his

Basis of Claim form (BOC) states that he engaged in a he terosexual relationship with one other

person of the opposite sex in Nigeria in an attempt to camouflage his true sexual orientation.

[4] The Respondent alleges that on [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , 2013 while he was going home, he was

stopped by an unknown person who advised [REDACTED] not to go home, as there was police looking for

him, and that there had been a killing in the neighbourhood. The unknown person told the

Respondent to hide; the Respondent later learnt that the person killed was his fiancé, [REDACTED] . The

Respondent alleges that the assailants were either police officers or individuals purported to be

the same.

[5] The Respondent further alleges that this unknown man took him to a restaurant where he
