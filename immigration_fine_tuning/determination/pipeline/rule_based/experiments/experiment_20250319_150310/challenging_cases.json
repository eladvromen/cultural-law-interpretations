They are appealing the de termination by the Minister\u2019s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA\n\n, because the Minister\u2019s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA\n\n. [2] Specifically, the appellants had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five- year period immediately after they became permanent residents, which was on March 27, 2003. The Minister\u2019s Delegate was also not sati sfied, pursuant to section 28(2)(c) of IRPA\n\n, that there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate c onsiderations, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the determination, to justify retention of permanent resident status and overcome the breach of the residency obligations. Background\n\n\n\n[3] The principal appellant is 44 years old. He was born on July 18, 1963 in Kuwait, but he is a citizen of Lebanon. His wife is 38 years old and a citizen of Lebanon. His son, E[REDACTED], is 9 years old and a citizen of Le banon. There is a second son, [REDACTED], who is 7 years old. He is not an appellant in this appeal. [4] The family came to Canada as permanent re sidents on March 27, 2003. They left Canada and returned to Kuwait on April 12, 2003, when the principal appellant\u2019s wife became ill in Canada with bronchial asthma.

The Principal Appellant, Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , and [REDACTED] are Nigerian\n\ncitizens. [REDACTED] was born in the United States and is therefore an American citizen. The\n\nAppellants fear political persecution in Nigeria due to the Principal Appellant\u2019s involvement i n\n\nthe All Progressives Congress (\u201cAPC\u201d) . The Appellants fear that members of the People\u2019 s\n\nDemocratic Party (\u201cPDP\u201d) will seek to harm them . The Refugee Protection Division (\u201cRPD\u201d)\n\nrejected the Appella nts\u2019 claims . The RPD identified problems with the credibility of the Principal\n\nAppellant\u2019s testimony. The panel appeared to accept the facts around the Principal Appellant\u2019s\n\npolitical activities , but it determined that there was a viable internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) in\n\nAbuja. The Appellants dispute this decision and provide new evidence that addresses the RPD\u2019s\n\nfindings.\n\n[2] The result of this appeal is a split decision . A claim against the United Sta tes was not\n\nadvanced for [REDACTED] at the RPD, nor have the Appellants disputed the RPD\u2019s reasons for\n\nrejecting her claim. No risks have been identified for [REDACTED] in the United States that would\n\nentitle her to refugee protection .

The visa officer\u2019s determination is legally valid . T he appellants\n\nare asking f or special relief on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds.\n\nHUMANITARIAN AND COMPASSIONATE GROUNDS\n\n[3] I heard testimony from the appellant , Mr. [REDACTED] . Based on the testimony, the Minister\u2019s\n\ncounsel recommended the appeal s be allowed for the reasons that follows .\n\n[4] Mr. [REDACTED] and his wife landed in July , 2009. We heard testimony that the appellants\n\nreturned to Iran because Mr. [REDACTED] had not yet retired from his job , and their second son was in\n\nuniversity in Iran at the time . Given the ties they stil l had to Iran, the appellants return ed in order\n\nto wind up their affairs , and to prepare for a late r stage of their life and retirement. Such is the\n\nreason for their departure from Canada .\n\n[5] The reason the appellants extended their stay abroad was because Mr. [REDACTED] \u2019s father\n\nhad heart problems in 2011 , and suffered from a stroke . Since Mr. [REDACTED] was a medical doctor,\n\nhe remained in Iran to take care of his father , as he felt that he was in the best position to do so ,\n\ngiven his training as a medical doctor.\n\n[6] Mr. [REDACTED] has a brother and three sisters in Teheran ; since his father is now recovered,\n\nhe testified that his siblings are able to assume the responsibility of the care of their father.

The Appellant asks\n\nthe Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to set aside the decision of the RPD, and find the Appellant\n\nto be a Convention refugee, or in the alternative, refer the claim back to the RPD for\n\nredetermination. The Appellant asks for a hearing to deal with the documentation presented in the\n\nMemorandum of Appeal.

The appeal is from a refusal to approve the permanent resident visa applications\n\nmade by Syl[REDACTED] and Ja[REDACTED] (the \u201capplicants\u201d) who\n\nwere sponsored by the appellant. Those are the appellant's biological parents.\n\n\n\n[2] The abili ty to sponsor family members is permitted by sections 12 and 13 of the\n\nImmigra tion and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201c Act \u201d).1 Eligibility to sponsor requires\n\ndemonstration of income at, or above, income levels that are set by the Immigration and Refugee\n\nProt ection R egulation s (the \u201c Regulations \u201d).2\n\n\n\n[3] This application was refused based on an assessment of income from December 2012, to\n\nDecember 2013, for five persons. At that time, the sponsor had to show income at, or above, the\n\nlevels established by regulation , which for five persons was $46,850.\n\n\n\n[4] The regulation setting out the requirement is 133(1)(j)(1) of the Regulations . At that time,\n\nwhen the assessment was completed, the appellant's income was assessed at $40,671. As a result,\n\nthere was a deficiency and t he application was refused.\n\n\n\n[5] The assessment in this case has been complicated by a number of factors, there were\n\nsubstantially changing circumstances over the time of processing the applicati on which was\n\nsubmitted in 2008, a nd there has been a fair amount of uncertainty and perhaps some confusion\n\nas well during the subsequent processing. Thus, the number of persons to be asses sed has been\n\nrelatively fluid, a nd for reasons explained in my analysis, that is also a factor in coming to the\n\nparticular decision i n this case.\n\n\n\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/200 2\u2013227.\n\n2016 CanLII 102556 (CA IRB)\n\nIAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAI : VB5 -01116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[6] The appellant con..."
