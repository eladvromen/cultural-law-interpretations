REASONS FOR DECISION

Introduction [1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal, pursuant to subsection 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

(IRPA ) of T[REDACTED] (the principal appellant), his wife, [REDACTED] (the appellant) and E[REDACTED] (the minor appellant). They are appealing the de termination by the Minister’s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA

, because the Minister’s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA

. [2] Specifically, the appellants had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five- year period immediately after they became permanent residents, which was on March 27, 2003. The Minister’s Delegate was also not sati sfied, pursuant to section 28(2)(c) of IRPA

, that there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate c onsiderations, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the determination, to justify retention of permanent resident status and overcome the breach of the residency obligations. Background



[3] The principal appellant is 44 years old. He was born on July 18, 1963 in Kuwait, but he is a citizen of Lebanon. His wife is 38 years old and a citizen of Lebanon. His son, E[REDACTED], is 9 years old and a citizen of Le banon. There is a second son, [REDACTED], who is 7 years old. He is not an appellant in this appeal. [4] The family came to Canada as permanent re sidents on March 27, 2003. They left Canada and returned to Kuwait on April 12, 2003, when the principal appellant’s wife became ill in Canada with bronchial asthma. The principal appellant returned on March 2, 2006 and remained

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) in the

appeals by J ahan[REDACTED], [REDACTED], Yasa [REDACTED]

and Naza[REDACTED] (the Appellants), from determinations made against them on

September 10, 2018. The Appellants were found to have failed to comply with the residency

obligation requirements in section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Act ).1 The

determinations that the Appellants breached the residency obligation were made outside Canada.





BACKGROUND



[2] The Appellants were landed in Canada in July 2012 with the Appellant Mr. [REDACTED] as a skilled worke r.2



[3] The Appellant Mr. [REDACTED] testified at the hearing on behalf of all the Appellants.

The Appellant Ms. Yasa[REDACTED] also provide some testimony and submissions.

Minister’s counsel provided written submission dated July 16, 2019.



[4] Additional documentary evidence was submitted.3





ANALYSIS



[5] The Appellants were physically present in Canada for less than 200 days in the relevant

five year period, between September 6, 2013 and September 5, 2018.4 Based on the evidence

before me, the Ap pellants have not met the residency obligation requirements under section 28

of the Act. Therefore , I find the determinations are valid in law.



[6] Pursuant to paragraph 67(1)(c) of the Act the IAD has been granted authority to consider

discretionary relief a nd permit appellants to retain their permanent resident status despite a

breach of the residency obligation. The test to be applied in the exercise of discretionary

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellants are [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“the Principal Appellant ”), his wife

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] ”), their minor son [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“[REDACTED] ”), and their minor daughter [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

(“[REDACTED] ”). The Principal Appellant, Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , and [REDACTED] are Nigerian

citizens. [REDACTED] was born in the United States and is therefore an American citizen. The

Appellants fear political persecution in Nigeria due to the Principal Appellant’s involvement i n

the All Progressives Congress (“APC”) . The Appellants fear that members of the People’ s

Democratic Party (“PDP”) will seek to harm them . The Refugee Protection Division (“RPD”)

rejected the Appella nts’ claims . The RPD identified problems with the credibility of the Principal

Appellant’s testimony. The panel appeared to accept the facts around the Principal Appellant’s

political activities , but it determined that there was a viable internal flight alternative (“IFA”) in

Abuja. The Appellants dispute this decision and provide new evidence that addresses the RPD’s

findings.

[2] The result of this appeal is a split decision . A claim against the United Sta tes was not

advanced for [REDACTED] at the RPD, nor have the Appellants disputed the RPD’s reasons for

rejecting her claim. No risks have been identified for [REDACTED] in the United States that would

entitle her to refugee protection . The Refugee Appeal Division (“RAD”) therefore a gree s with

the RPD’s reasons for rejecting her claim. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)( a) of the Immigration

and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”), the appeal in regard to [REDACTED] claim is dismissed.

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal s of [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] (the appellants) , who appeal ed from a determin ation that they breached the

residency obligation.

ISSUE

[2] The five -year period under consideration is from July 5, 2010 to July 5, 2015. The parties

agreed that the appellants were in the country for only 249 days during the five -year period. This

is only 34 percent compliance. The visa officer’s determination is legally valid . T he appellants

are asking f or special relief on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds.

HUMANITARIAN AND COMPASSIONATE GROUNDS

[3] I heard testimony from the appellant , Mr. [REDACTED] . Based on the testimony, the Minister’s

counsel recommended the appeal s be allowed for the reasons that follows .

[4] Mr. [REDACTED] and his wife landed in July , 2009. We heard testimony that the appellants

returned to Iran because Mr. [REDACTED] had not yet retired from his job , and their second son was in

university in Iran at the time . Given the ties they stil l had to Iran, the appellants return ed in order

to wind up their affairs , and to prepare for a late r stage of their life and retirement. Such is the

reason for their departure from Canada .

[5] The reason the appellants extended their stay abroad was because Mr. [REDACTED] ’s father

had heart problems in 2011 , and suffered from a stroke . Since Mr. [REDACTED] was a medical doctor,

he remained in Iran to take care of his father , as he felt that he was in the best position to do so ,

given his training as a medical doctor.

[6] Mr. [REDACTED] has a brother and three sisters in Teheran ; since his father is now recovered,

he testified that his siblings are able to assume the responsibility of the care of their father. The

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the Appellant) is a citizen of Saint Lucia. She appeals a decision of the

Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection. The Appellant asks

the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to set aside the decision of the RPD, and find the Appellant

to be a Convention refugee, or in the alternative, refer the claim back to the RPD for

redetermination. The Appellant asks for a hearing to deal with the documentation presented in the

Memorandum of Appeal. No new evidence was presented in the Me morandum of Appeal.

DETERMINATION

[2] Pursuant to ss. 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD

confirms the determination of the RPD and dismisses the appeal.

Background

[3] The Appellant was raised by her stepmother, and does not ha ve any knowledge of her

biological mother. The Appellant discovered during her teenage years that she was more attracted

to girls than boys. As a result of the homophobic attitudes in Saint Lucia, the [REDACTED] became

withdrawn and unhappy emotionally. The Appellant discovered a girl in the school who felt the

same way, and began a nonsexual relationship. After the relationship became more physical, they

were discovered by other students who made life a torment at school. Both she and her friend

dropped out of secondary school in [REDACTED] 1997. The Appellant ’s father and stepmother tried to

convince her to go back to school in another location, but she refused, and ran away from home.

While living on the streets, a man befriended her, took her into his home, and she became

sexually active with him. After the birth of a daughter on [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , 2000, the relationship

ended, but she continued to live with this man in a nonsexual relationship, all the time seeing her

girlfriend from high school. At the Appellant ’s wor kplace, she and her girlfriend were discovered

Reasons for Decision

[1] [REDACTED] (the principal appellant), his wife, [REDACTED] , and their

children, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]the appellants) are appealing from the departure

orders1 dated November 30, 2011, issued against them by Member [REDACTED] of the Immigration

Division (ID) for the reason that they are persons described in section 41(b) of the Immigration and

Refugee Protection Act2 (IRPA ) as they failed to comply with section 27(2) of the IRPA. The

principal appellant and the appellants are citizens of Syria.

[2] The principal appellant and the appellants were landed on June 10, 2005. The principal

appellant was landed in the entrepreneur class and the appellants were his dependents. The

Immigration Division (ID) found that the principal appellant had not respected the terms prescribed

under section 23.1(1) (a) to (d) of the Immigration Regulations 1978 (the Regulations )3 for persons

who immigrated as entrepreneurs and are deemed to be imposed4 under the IRPA.5 The principal

appellant had applied for a permanent resident visa in 1999.6

[3] There was no challenge to the validity of the remova l orders, and the panel finds nothing in the

evidence at the hearing that would render the orders legally invalid. Accordingly, the panel finds that

the removal orders are valid in law. Consequently, the issue in this appeal is whether, taking into

account the best interest of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.7 The

principal appellant and the appellants have the burden of m eeting this statutory test.

1 REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED], her husband [REDACTED], and their sons [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] (the “appellants”) appeal the departure or ders issued against each one of them by the Member of the Immigration Division (the “ID” ) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the “IRB”) on September 3, 2010, because they were found to be persons described in the subsection 27(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the “Act”),

1 and therefore, they were inadmissible under subsection 41(b) of the Act. [2] Section 318 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (the “Regulations”)

2 provides that any terms and conditions imposed under the former Immigration Act,

3 become terms and conditions under the present Act, which came into force in June 2002. [3] The appeals are made pursuant to subsection 63(3)

4 of the Act. [4] The appellants’ counsel confirmed that the appe llants did not challenge the legal validity of the departure orders made against them a nd they requested that the Immigration Appeal Division (the “IAD”) exercise its discretionary jurisdiction. [5] The appellants base their appeal on paragraph 67(1)(c) of the Act, which provides as follow: 67(1) To allow an appeal, the Immigration Appeal Division must be satisfied that, at the time the appeal is disposed of, (c) other than in the case of an appeal by the Minister, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.

2 The panel appointed the XX as the Designated Representative (DR) of the minor claimant. Allegations [2] The PC alleges that she joined the polit ical party Organisation du Peuple en Lutte (OPL). She alleges that on [REDACTED] 1997, a bu llet entered her home, which prompted her to go into hiding. She travelled with her daught er to the USA in [REDACTED] 1997. She claims to have made an asylum claim which was late r refused. She made a claim for protection in Canada in [REDACTED] 2007. She claims a well -founded fear of persecution for reason of her political opinion and her membership in a particular social group, namely her gender. [3] The minor claimant has French nationalit y by virtue of her birth at [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. The PC did not advance any evidence of perse cution or personalized risk for the minor claimant in her country of nationality.

In reaching this decision, the panel considered the Chairperson’s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.

3 The determinative issues were the credi bility of the claimant, the subjective fear and the personalized risk. The panel’s reasons are as follows:

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] Eissa[REDACTED]the principal appellant), his wife Huda Omar I[REDACTED] their children [REDACTED] , [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the appellants) are appealing from the departures orders dated March 29, 2012, made

against them by Member [REDACTED] of the Immigration Division (ID) for the reason that they

are persons described in section 41 (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA) as

they failed to comply with section 27(2) of the IRPA.

[2] The principal appellant and the appellants were landed on November 1st, 2008.2 The

principal appellant was landed in the entrepreneur class and the appellants were his dependents.

The ID found that the principal appellant had not respected t he terms prescribed under section

98(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations3 (IRPR). The appellants were

landed with the condition that the entrepreneur meets the conditions set out in section 98 of the

IRPR.

[3] There was no challenge to the validity of the removal orders, and the panel finds nothing

in the evidence at the hearing that would render the orders legally invalid. Accordingly, the panel

finds that the removal orders are valid in law. Consequently, the issue in this appeal is wheth er,

taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient

humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the

circumstances of the case.4 The principal appellant and the appella nts have the burden of meeting

this statutory test on a balance of probabilities.

Reasons for Decision

Introduction and Issue [1] These are three appeals pursu ant to section 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

1 (IRPA) of departure orders based on IRPA section 41(b) made against each of the three appellants. The appellants are a mother

2 (“appellant mother”) and her two daughters ([REDACTED],

3 “eldest appellant daughter”; and [REDACTED] “youngest appellant daughter”). [2] The appellants do not contest the validity of the departure orders and the issue is whether the appellants have proven that there are gr ounds to warrant special relief, pursuant to IRPA section 67(c). Decision [3] Having considered the evidence and submissi ons, and especially the submissions of the respondent, the panel finds that the departure orders are valid in law. The panel finds that the three appellants have proven on a balance of pr obabilities that their appeals warrant special relief. The three appeals are allowed.

Background [4] The Immigration Division held an admissibility hearing in September 2008

5 and issued a departure order against each appellant.

6 The departure orders were based on non-compliance with the entrepreneurial class entry conditions of the husband/father permanent resident (who is not a party to this appeal).

7 The three appellants appeal from those orders.8 [5] With the agreement of the appellants and respondent, the appeals of the three appellants were dealt with at the same hearing, with all evidence applying to each appeal, and one ...</div>

RPD File No. :

[1] [REDACTED], the principal claimant (PC), is a citizen of the Republic of Haiti (Haiti) who seeks refugee protection pursu ant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

1 (IRPA). The claim of her daughter, [REDACTED], the minor claimant, was joined pursuant to Rule 49.1.

2 The panel appointed the XX as the Designated Representative (DR) of the minor claimant. Allegations [2] The PC alleges that she joined the polit ical party Organisation du Peuple en Lutte (OPL). She alleges that on [REDACTED] 1997, a bu llet entered her home, which prompted her to go into hiding. She travelled with her daught er to the USA in [REDACTED] 1997. She claims to have made an asylum claim which was late r refused. She made a claim for protection in Canada in [REDACTED] 2007. She claims a well -founded fear of persecution for reason of her political opinion and her membership in a particular social group, namely her gender. [3] The minor claimant has French nationalit y by virtue of her birth at [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. The PC did not advance any evidence of perse cution or personalized risk for the minor claimant in her country of nationality. Issues and Determination [4] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection. In reaching this decision, the panel considered the Chairperson’s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.

3 The determinative issues were the credi bility of the claimant, the subjective fear and the personalized risk. The panel’s reasons are as follows:

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] ,

citizens of Croatia ,1 seek refugee protection under sectio ns 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and

Refugee Protection Act . These claims were joined because the claimants are a family, including

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] , mother, [REDACTED] .

ALLEGATIONS

[2] The female claimant , [REDACTED] , alleges that she is a lesbian whose husband knew tha t she was ,

but loved her and asked her to marry him and ha ve children with him, but to live separate lives.

This was the claimant ’s cover. Two years ago , people in her city found out about her because they

saw her with her girlfriend , and lesbians or gay p eople are not welcome in her country. Citizens of

their country threatened that they were going to beat her up, and were also going to hit her kids , her

husband and her mother because they are sick people. They threatened her husband because he was

prote cting her and living with her. The children were called all kinds of names and her son had a lot

of fights because of that . He was in the hospital twice because of a broken arm and a cu t muscle on

his right lower leg. The kids don ’t want to go to school beca use they are afraid, and the claimant ’s

mother has also been threatened. They threatened on the phone that they w ould kill the female

claimant . They did not go to the police because they couldn ’t get any protection until they were

hurt.

DECISION

[3] I find tha t the claimants are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection

as they do not have a fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Croatia. I also find that the

claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to Cr oatia would not subject

them personally to a risk to their lives , nor are there grounds to believe that their removal to Croatia

will subject them personally to a danger of torture.

RPD File No. :



[1] [REDACTED] (the principal claimant) and his wife [REDACTED] , citizens of Syria, claim

refugee protection pursuant to Section s 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection

Act1 (IRPA).

Background and Allegations

[2] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative to the claimants’ Personal Information

Forms2 (PIFs); the following is a summary.

[3] The claimants have a son who has been granted refugee status in Canada. In 2008 they

attempted to come to Canada to visit that son, but were denied visitor visas since immigration

officials were not convinced they would return to Syria.3 They were successful in obtaining vis itor

visas in 2010, and arrived in Canada in [REDACTED] of that year. The following month they filed claims

for refugee protection. They claim that they are of Kurdish ethnicity, and that their two politically -

active sons were persecuted by the authorities bef ore fleeing the country. The intelligence service

allegedly detained and abused the principal claimant because they sought his sons. The claimants

fear that, if returned to Syria, they will be harmed or killed by the Syrian authorities.

Determination

[4] I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.

Analysis

[5] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.

Identity

[6] Each claimant’s identity as a national of Syria is established by the personal identity

docume nts filed.4

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (the “IAD”)

pertaining to the appeal filed pursuant to subsection 63(1) of the Immigration and Refugee

Protection Act (the “ Act ”)1 made by [REDACTED] (the “appellant”), from the refusal of the

sponsorship application for a permanent resident visa of her spouse, Jam[REDACTED]

(the “applicant”) from Afghanistan.



[2] The application was refused under subsection 4(1) of the Immigration and Refugee

Protection Regulations (the “ Regulations ”)2 and subsection 16(1) of the Act . The details of the

refusal are set out in the refusal letter and C AIPS3 notes of the immigration officer.4



BACKGROUND



[3] The appellant is 52 years old and was landed in Canada in April 1984. The applicant is 37

years old and lives in Afghanistan. The appellant and applicant were married on May 12, 2009.5



ANALYSIS



[4] Two t ests may be applied in order to disqualify a spouse under subsection 4(1) of the

Regulations. Only one of the tests must be satisfied if an applicant is to be disqualified as a

spouse. The two tests are: that the marriage is not genuine and that the marria ge was entered into

primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the Act. The determination of

whether or not the marriage is genuine is made at the time of the hearing, nonetheless, given the

nature of marriage, as a relationship bet ween a husband and wife, I find the existence of a

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are my reasons and decision in the appeal of [REDACTED] (the

“appellan t”). The appeal is from a refusal to approve the permanent resident visa applications

made by Syl[REDACTED] and Ja[REDACTED] (the “applicants”) who

were sponsored by the appellant. Those are the appellant's biological parents.



[2] The abili ty to sponsor family members is permitted by sections 12 and 13 of the

Immigra tion and Refugee Protection Act (the “ Act ”).1 Eligibility to sponsor requires

demonstration of income at, or above, income levels that are set by the Immigration and Refugee

Prot ection R egulation s (the “ Regulations ”).2



[3] This application was refused based on an assessment of income from December 2012, to

December 2013, for five persons. At that time, the sponsor had to show income at, or above, the

levels established by regulation , which for five persons was $46,850.



[4] The regulation setting out the requirement is 133(1)(j)(1) of the Regulations . At that time,

when the assessment was completed, the appellant's income was assessed at $40,671. As a result,

there was a deficiency and t he application was refused.



[5] The assessment in this case has been complicated by a number of factors, there were

substantially changing circumstances over the time of processing the applicati on which was

submitted in 2008, a nd there has been a fair amount of uncertainty and perhaps some confusion

as well during the subsequent processing. Thus, the number of persons to be asses sed has been

relatively fluid, a nd for reasons explained in my analysis, that is also a factor in coming to the

particular decision i n this case.

[1] Madam, I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am

ready to render my decision orally. A written form of the reasons will be provided to you and

your counsel shortly. The written form may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar and

references to the applicable case law an d documentary evidence may also be included.

[2] This is the decision of the refugee protection division in the claim of [REDACTED] , a citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by birth and a citizen of the Commonwealth

of Grenada by naturalization, who s eeks refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection

97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA) .

ALLEGATIONS

[3] Ms. [REDACTED] , you allege that you are bi -sexual . Y ou allege that you fear persecution for

reasons of your membership in a pa rticular social group, namely your sexual orientation in

Grenada and Nigeria. You allege made a radio broadcast supporting homosexuality in Grenada;

fearing for your life you fled to Canada where you made a claim for protection nine months after

your arriv al in this country.

DETERMINATION

[4] I find there is not a serious possibility that you face persecution on Convention grounds in

Grenada or that you face a danger of torture in that country or that, on the balance of probabilities,

you face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon your return to

that country. In light of that determination it is not necessary for me to examine your claim

against Nigeria. The determinative issue for me was your credibility as a witness and my reasons

are as follows.
