Reasons for Decision



[1] On May 8, 2008 Member [REDACTED] of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) granted Or[REDACTED] (the appellant) a stay (on conditions) of the deportation order issued against him on May 7, 2007. The stay was gr anted to the appellant based on the written recommendation of the respondent. The duration of the stay was for one year and it included 12 conditions. [2] On February 25, 2010 Member [REDACTED] of the IAD extended the stay for another six months because the appellant did not obtain his passport. Minister’s counsel at that time consented to the extension of the stay in order to allow the appellant to obtain his passport. [3] On November 2, 2010 the stay was further extended. On December 9, 2010 the appellant was sent a Notice of Reconsideration and on March 7, 2011 the Minister submitted a written statement indicating that the appellant had not complied with his stay and pointed to further criminality, his failure to obtain a passport and his failure to provide a Statement of Compliance.

Oral Reasons for Decision

[1] This is the decision in the appeal by [REDACTED] (the appellant) from a deportation order made against him on November 16, 2000 following his conviction for trafficking narcotics on April 26, 1996 where he received a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment. [2] This deportation order was stayed by the Immigrat ion Appeal Division’s Member [REDACTED] on December 10, 2001. At that time, following a recommendation by the Minister’s counsel and taking into account different humanitarian and compassionate factors, Member [REDACTED] concluded that such a stay was warranted. I will quote from th e Member’s decision on page 2.

(IRPA ) of T[REDACTED] (the principal appellant), his wife, [REDACTED] (the appellant) and E[REDACTED] (the minor appellant). They are appealing the de termination by the Minister’s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA

, because the Minister’s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA

. [2] Specifically, the appellants had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five- year period immediately after they became permanent residents, which was on March 27, 2003. The Minister’s Delegate was also not sati sfied, pursuant to section 28(2)(c) of IRPA

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The appellant , [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , a citizen of Congo -Brazzaville , is

appealing against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his refugee

protection claim . He argue d that his life was in danger because he was being sought by the

Congolese police for his involvement in the electio n campaign of a defeated candidate during the

2016 presidential election . The RPD found that the appellant was not credible and that he was

not involved in the presidential campaign. The appellant is contesting that finding on the grounds

that the RPD gave too much weight to peripheral aspects of the record when assessing his

credibility. Furthermore, he argues that there was a breach of procedural fairness during the

hearing because the panel repeatedly interrupted his lawyer when she was trying to speak .

[2] Having listened to the entire recording of the RPD hearing, I am of the opinion that the

panel’s interventions were justified. However, I conclude tha...</div>
