She\n\nbecame a permanent resident of Canada in 2012. After landing in Canada, the A ppellant stayed\n\nhere for about two months. She returned to Trinidad and Tobago to wrap up her affairs. Later, her\n\nparents became ill, which prevented her from retuning back to Canada sooner.\n\n[2] In 2020, the Appellant applied for a Permanent Resident Travel D ocument to return to\n\nCanada, but the visa officer refused her application. The Appellant did not respect her residency\n\nobligations to be present in Canada in the relevant five -year period for at least 730 days.1 In the\n\nrelevant five -year period, she was pr esent for only 136 days.\n\n[3] The Appellant appealed the visa officer\u2019s decision to the Immigration Appeal Division. She\n\nadmitted that the visa officer \u2019s decision is legally valid. She is relying on humanitarian and\n\ncompassionate reasons for the appeal to be allowed.\n\n[4] The Appellant\u2019s hearing was scheduled for three hours on June 18, 2021. I heard testimony\n\nfrom the Appellant, but we were not able to finish the hearing that day. I adjourned the matter for\n\nNovember 8, 2021, for a full day , to continue the hearing.\n\n[5] In a letter dated November 3, 2021, the Appellant asked to withdraw her appeal. The\n\nMinister submits that the withdrawal of the appeal is an abuse of process and asks that the appeal\n\nbe dismissed.2\n\n[6] The issues are:\n\n\uf0b7 Is the Appellan t\u2019s application to withdraw her appeal an abuse of process?\n\n\uf0b7 If I determine the withdrawal is an abuse of process , should the appeal be\n\ndismissed on its merits or abandoned ?\n\n[7] The Appellant\u2019s application to withdraw her appeal is an abuse of process. I dismi ss the\n\nAppellant\u2019s application. I find that the appeal has been..."

The Appellant and his parents landed in\n\nCanada in April 2005 when he was three and a half years old . They left Kuwait because of\n\npolitical inst ability. The Appellant and his parents stayed in Canada for 11 days and returned to\n\nKuwait because the political situation had improved.\n\n[2] In February 2019, when the Appellant was 17 years old, he applied for his permanent\n\nresident travel document (PRTD) b ecause he wanted to return to Canada to study. In July 2019,\n\nthe visa officer denied the Appellant \u2019s application because he had not met his residency\n\nobligations ---the Appellant had not been physically in Canada for the past 5 years. Permanent\n\nresidents (PR) are required to be in Canada for at least 730 in any five -year period in order to\n\nmaintain their PR status. At the time when the Appellant applied for his PRTD, he had not\n\nreturned to Canada since he had left at the age of three and a half years old.\n\n[3] The Appellant admits that he has not met his residency obligation and appeals the matter\n\non humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds in order for him to maintain his PR status.\n\n[4] In August 2019, the Appellant came to Canada through a land border. Current ly, the\n\nAppellant lives and studies in Canada.\n\n[5] The Appellant \u2019s position is that the appeal should be allowed because it was not his\n\nparents\u2019 choice, and not his, to leave Canada; he is now established in Canada and he will suffer\n\nhardship if the appeal is dismissed. In contrast, the Minister\u2019s position is that the appeal should\n\nbe dismissed because the Appellant has not provided sufficient H&C grounds to overcome the\n\nsignificant breach.\n\n[6] I find there are sufficient H&C grounds to allow the appeal.

The appellant\n\nindicated in her Permanent Resident Travel Document application that she had been physically\n\npresent in Canada for zero days in the five years preceding Marc h 21, 2018 (\u201cthe period\u201d). The\n\nvisa officer who examined the appellant's PRTD application refused it on April 12, 2018, as the\n\nappellant did not meet the requirements of section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection\n\nAct (\u201cthe Act \u201d), and indeed had last been physically present in Canada in October 2009. The visa\n\nofficer noted that in the 5 -year period prior to the application, the appellant had zero days of\n\nphysical presence in Canada, but the officer did consider whether time spent with her Canadia n\n\ncitizen spouse in Cuba would count toward her residency obligation. Even if this time was\n\nincluded, however, it would only amount to 252 days in the five -year period, and the appellant\n\nwas still in breach of the residency obligation. The appellant appe aled the decision of the visa\n\nofficer on May 16, 2018, and this is the decision in her appeal.\n\n\n\nHEARING\n\n\n\n[2] At the hearing, the appellant was present over the telephone. She was represented by\n\ncounsel at the first sitting, and her husband and daughter attend ed the hearing as witnesses.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the difficulty in telephoning in and out of Cuba, the hearing did not\n\nconclude and the second sitting was required.

In fact, on the date of the decision at the port of entry, that is,\n\nNovember 12, 2015, the appellant had been present in Canada for approximately 30 days.\n\nFollowing the depart ure order, the tendency of being absent from Canada changed considerably,\n\nand he has spent most of his time in Canada since the order was issued in 2015. The appellant is\n\nnot challenging the legal validity of the decision. He is requesting that the panel consider the\n\nvarious humanitarian and comp assionate considerations in his case.\n\n\n\n[2] Considering the appellant\u2019s position and the evidence in the case, the panel concludes\n\nthat the officer\u2019s decision is valid in law. Now, concerning the humanitarian and compassionate\n\naspects, the panel is guided by the jurisprudence, specifically, the factors that have been\n\nestablished since Bufete Arce .1 The main factors to consider are the extent of the non -compliance\n\nwith the residency obligation, the initial and continuing degree of establishment in Canada , the\n\nreasons for departure from Canada, whether reasonable attempts to return to Can ada were made\n\nand the hardship and dislocation that could be cause d to the appellant and his family members by\n\na dismissal and, cert ainly, the best interests of any minor child directly affected by this decision\n\nand any other factor s that could be relevant and co..."

This matter had been postponed on numerous occasions. On the day of his\n\nreconsideration, the appellant failed to appear despite the presence of his counsel. Accordin gly,\n\nIAD M ember [REDACTED] dismissed the appeal. Here are the reasons contained in the last 2\n\nparagraphs of his reasons:\n\nGiven the appellant has been aware of his reconsideration appeal hearing and was\n\ncounselled by this Panel on January 29, 2018, about the importance of appearing before\n\nthe IAD with respect to his stay reconsideration, as well as to ensure compliance with any\n\npossible stay order extensions, the fact that he failed to appear suggests that he is no\n\nlonger pursing his appeal and recognizes that he will be eventually removed to Guyana.\n\nAccordingly, the Panel sees no other alternative other than to dismiss the appellant\u2019s\n\nappeal for lack of interest.
