REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] A permanent resident (“PR”) of Canada is required to be physically present in Canada for

at least 730 days in a five year period, or fall into one of the exceptions permitted in Canada’s

legislation. [REDACTED] (“the appellant”) is a 54 year old ci tizen of the Philippines who

became a PR of Canada on June 16, 2012. The appellant applied for a permanent resident travel

document (“PRTD”) on March 23, 2017 in Makati City, Philippines. His application was refused

on June 9, 2017, as he did not meet the requirements of section 28 of the Immigration and

Refugee Protection Act1 (hereinafter “the Act ”). The visa officer noted that in the five year period

before March 23, 2017 (“the period”), the appellant was physically present in Canada for 135

days. The ap pellant appealed the decision of the visa officer on August 8, 2017, and this is the

decision in his appeal.

[2] At the hearing, the appellant was present over the telephone. He did not have counsel,

and his wife initially indicated that she wanted t o represent him, but after some discussion, she

agreed that it would be best if she provided evidence as a witness instead of questioning him. As

a result, the panel and the Minister's counsel questioned the applicant at length. The panel and

Minister's counsel also questioned the appellant's two children, both adults now, and his wife.

Everything was interpreted to the appellant over the telephone, and after the submissions were

done, he indicated that he had not heard any of the submissions provided by the Minister's

counsel. As a result, the parties agreed that the appellant's wife would be provide...</div>

IAD.34.01 (2021. 11.24)

Available in French REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellant, Veroni[REDACTED], is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. She

became a permanent resident of Canada in 2012. After landing in Canada, the A ppellant stayed

here for about two months. She returned to Trinidad and Tobago to wrap up her affairs. Later, her

parents became ill, which prevented her from retuning back to Canada sooner.

[2] In 2020, the Appellant applied for a Permanent Resident Travel D ocument to return to

Canada, but the visa officer refused her application. The Appellant did not respect her residency

obligations to be present in Canada in the relevant five -year period for at least 730 days.1 In the

relevant five -year period, she was pr esent for only 136 days.

[3] The Appellant appealed the visa officer’s decision to the Immigration Appeal Division. She

admitted that the visa officer ’s decision is legally valid. She is relying on humanitarian and

compassionate reasons for the appeal to be allowed.

[4] The Appellant’s hearing was scheduled for three hours on June 18, 2021. I heard testimony

from the Appellant, but we were not able to finish the hearing that day. I adjourned the matter for

November 8, 2021, for a full day , to continue the hearing.

[5] In a letter dated November 3, 2021, the Appellant asked to withdraw her appeal. The

Minister submits that the withdrawal of the appeal is an abuse of process and asks that the appeal

be dismissed.2

[6] The issues are:

 Is the Appellan t’s application to withdraw her appeal an abuse of process?

 If I determine the withdrawal is an abuse of process , should the appeal be

dismissed on its merits or abandoned ?

[7] The Appellant’s application to withdraw her appeal is an abuse of process. I dismi ss the

Appellant’s application. I find that the appeal has been...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeals of [REDACTED] (MB4 -

03412) and Ale[REDACTED] (MB5 -04579) (herein collectively referred as the

appellants) from decisions made because of their failure to comply with the residency obligation

set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (the Act ). The hearings were joined and

heard simultaneously with the consent of the parties . Ale[REDACTED] was not present ,

he appeared via his counsel. He did not testify and he adopt ed the testimony of his father. The

Minister’s representative was not present at these hearings and filed written submissions.

[2] Section 28 of the Act requires a permanent resident to physically be present in Canada for

at least 730 days in the five -year perio d immediately prior to an assessment, which in the case of

[REDACTED] was prior his arriv al at the Canadian border in August 2014 and in the case

of [REDACTED] re this was prior to his application for a travel document in June 2015.

[3] The appellants, do n ot challenge the legal validity of the removal order but argue that the

appeal s should be allowed on the basis that sufficient humanitarian and compassionate

considerations warrant special relief, in light of all the circumstances of the case, taking into

account the best interests of any child directly affected by the decision.

[4] I have considered the testimony of the appellant [REDACTED] and his son [REDACTED],

the record and the documents filed by the appellants ,2 the respondent ’s written submissions and

the submissions of the appellants.

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and de cision of the Immigration Appeal Division (the “IAD”) in

the appeal by [REDACTED] (the “appellant”) from a determination made against her on

February 4, 2016. The appellant was found to have failed to comply with the residency

obligation of section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the “ Act ”),1 more

particularly that the appellant had not resided in Canada for at least 730 days in the five -year

period immediately before February 1, 2016.



ISSUE



[2] The appellant did not challenge the lega l validity of the determination. The appellant

became a permanent resident of Canada, at the age of 25, in April 2009. She was a dependant of

her parents. The appellant conceded that she was not physically present in Canada in the five -

year period February 1, 2011 to Janu ary 31 , 2016. The appellant asked that I exercise my

discretionary jurisdiction and allow the appeal on humanitarian and compassionate

considerations.



[3] The relevant paragraph of s ection 28 of the Act reads as follows:



28(1) A permanent res ident must comply with a residency obligation with respect to

every five -year period.

(2) The following provisions govern the residency obligation under subsection (1):

(a) a permanent resident complies with the residency obligation with

respect to a five -year period if, on each of a total of at least 730 days in that

five -year period, they are

(i) physically present in Canada,…

became permanent residents of Canada in August 2001. The appellants were not physically

present in Canada in the five -year period between February 28, 2008 and February 27, 2013. The

appellants asked that I exercise my discretionary jurisdiction and allow the appeals on

humanitarian and compassionate considerations.



[3] The relevant paragraph of s ection 28 of the Act reads as follows:



28 (1) “A permanent resident must comply with a residency obligation with

respect to every five -year period.

(2) The following provisions govern the residency obligation under subsection (1):

(a) a permanent resident complies with the residency obli gation with

respect to a five -year period if, on each of a total of at least 730 days

in that five -year period, they are

(i) physically present in Canada,… ”



[4] The test to be applied in the exercise of discretionary jurisdiction is that the IAD must be

satis fied at the time the appeal is disposed of, taking into account the best interests of a child

directly affected by the decision, there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate

considerations that warrant special relief in light of all the circumstance s of the case. Prior

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and decision of the I mmigration Appeal Division ( IAD) i n an appeal

by N[REDACTED] ( Appellant NC ) and [REDACTED] Ma CANEO (Appellant QC) from

exclusion order s made against them . The exclusion order s were made pursuant to paragraph

40(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA ).1





BACKGROUND



[2] Appellant NC is a 53 year old citizen of the Philippines who came to Canada in 2004 as a

live -in caregiver. In approximately 2008 she was given a work permit in Canada. On

March 20, 2013 she became a permanent resident of Canada.



[3] [REDACTED] is a 26 year old citizen of th e Philippines. She is the daughter of Appellant

NC. She was sponsored by Appellant NC and became a permanent resident of Canada on May

31, 201 3.



[4] Appellant XX has a daughter who was born on August 24, 2012, [REDACTED] CANEO

(NKC) . At the time of landing , neither Appellant NC nor Appellant QC declared the child as a

dependent.



[5] On June 27, 2013, Appellant NC submitted an application to add her granddaughter as a

dependent. As Appellant NC was already landed the application was refused.



[6] On December 20, 20 13 Appellant QC applied to sponsor her daughter to Canada. A

procedural fairness letter was sent to Appellant QC asking why she did not declare her daughter.

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] This is the decision concerning the appeal filed by [REDACTED] (the appellant), a

citizen of Algeria, against a decision made at the St -Bernard -de-Lacolle port of entry on

November 25, 2015, by an immigration officer who concluded that the appellant, under

section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (the Act) , did not reside in Canada for

at least 730 days during the five -year period from November 2010 to November 2015. I n fact,

the appellant appears to have been completely absent from Canada during this period.

[2] The appellant is not challenging the legal validity of the decision but is asking the panel

to take into consideration the various humanitarian and compassionate considerations present in

his case . Considering the evidence in its entirety, the panel finds that the officer’s decision is

valid in law.

[3] Typically i n this type of case , the panel is guided by the case law that has been

developed , particularly since [REDACTED] .2 In making its decision, t he panel will consider various

factors, of which the follow ing is not an exhaustive list: the extent of non -compliance with the

residency obligation; the degree of establishment in Canada; reasons for departure and for the

lengthy stay abroad; reasonable attempts to return to Canada; ties to Canada, including the

appellant’s family members in Canada ; hardship and dislocation that would be caused to the

appellant and his family members in Canada were the appeal to be dismissed ; the best interests

of any minor child directly affected by this decision ; and any other r elevant factor.

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (a.k.a. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , the principal Appellant) and her

minor daughters [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (a.k.a. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] ) and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (a.k.a. [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] ), the minor Appellants , citizens of Nigeria, appeal a decision of the Refugee

Protection Division (RPD) denying their claims for refugee protection. The principal Appellant

has agreed to act as the D esignated Representative for her minor daughters with respect to thei r

claims. They have not submitted any new evidence in support of their claims but have requested

an oral hearing. The Appellants request that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the

determination of the RPD and find that they are Convention refugee s or persons in need of

protection or, in the alternative, to refer the matter back to the RPD.

DETERMINATION

[2] Pursuant to sub section 111(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),

the RAD refers the principal Appellant’s claim back to the RPD for re -determination. The

principal Appellant’s appeal is allowed.

[3] Pursuant to sub section 11 1(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the determination of the

RPD regarding the minor Appellant s’ claims. These appeals are dismissed.

BACKGROUND

[4] The principal Appellant alleged before the RPD that she fears for her safety on the basis of

her sexual orientation if she has to return to her home country of Nigeria. She claims that she is a

bisexual woman. She also alleges that her childr en may be impacted as a result by possibly being

removed from her custody, and also alleges that there is a possibility that she and/or her children

may be subject to female genital mutilation (FGM) if they return to Nigeria.

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the claimant) is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Communist regime and in particular, the Public Security Bureau, by reason of his political opinion as a Falun Gong practitioner. In addition, he claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a dange r of torture in the People's Republic of China. ALLEGATIONS: The claimant alleges that he started to practice Falun Gong in [REDACTED] 2003 in order to improve his health. The claimant stated that on [REDACTED], 2003, the Public Security Bureau raided his Falun Gong practice group. The claimant stated that he was not present at the time but was advised to go into hiding, which he did. The claimant indicated that he learned, while in hiding, that the Public Security Bureau had come to his home, looking to arrest him. The claimant made arrangements to leave the country and arrived in Canada on [REDACTED], 2003. DETERMINATION: I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

The claimant stated that he left the People's Republic of China with his own genuine passport via the Beijing Airport. It was put to the claimant that the country documentation

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (the “IAD”) in

the appeal s by [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and Ha[REDACTED] (the

“appellants”) from a decision made outside Canada against them . The appellants were found to

have failed to comply with the residency obligation of section 28 of the Immigration and

Refugee Protection Act (the “ Act ”),1 more particul arly that the appellants had not resided in

Canada for at least 730 days in the five -year period under review.



[2] The appellants were represented by counsel. [REDACTED] (M rs. [REDACTED]) was the

designated representative for her minor daughter [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] was present in person.

Her husband, the appellant H[REDACTED] (Mr. [REDACTED]) appeared by telephone. Both

adult appellants testified. The Minister’s counsel did not appear but he provided materials2 and

written submissions. The Minister ’s po sition is that the appellants have not complied with their

residency obligation and have not shown on a balance of probabilities, considering the best

interests of a child, that sufficient humanitarian and compassionate factors exist in order to

warrant th e IAD’s granting of discretionary relief.



ISSUE



[3] The appellants did not challenge the legal validity of the determination. The review

period for M rs. [REDACTED] and her daughter is from July 10, 2010 to July 9, 2015 (their application

for a travel document was received July 9, 2015). The review period for Mr. [REDACTED] is from

January 16, 2011 to January 15, 2016. There is a dispute over the number of days Mrs. [REDACTED]

was in the country with her daughter but the evidence suggests they were in Canada between 198

and 227 days during the review period. Mr. [REDACTED] was in Canada for 85 days during the review

period. They concede they were not physically present in Canada for the requ...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION

Introduction [1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal, pursuant to subsection 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

(IRPA ) of T[REDACTED] (the principal appellant), his wife, [REDACTED] (the appellant) and E[REDACTED] (the minor appellant). They are appealing the de termination by the Minister’s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA

, because the Minister’s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA

. [2] Specifically, the appellants had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five- year period immediately after they became permanent residents, which was on March 27, 2003. The Minister’s Delegate was also not sati sfied, pursuant to section 28(2)(c) of IRPA

, that there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate c onsiderations, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the determination, to justify retention of permanent resident status and overcome the breach of the residency obligations. Background



[3] The principal appellant is 44 years old. He was born on July 18, 1963 in Kuwait, but he is a citizen of Lebanon. His wife is 38 years old and a citizen of Lebanon. His son, E[REDACTED], is 9 years old and a citizen of Le banon. There is a second son, [REDACTED], who is 7 years old. He is not an appellant in this appeal. [4] The family came to Canada as permanent re sidents on March 27, 2003. They left Canada and returned to Kuwait on April 12, 2003, when the principal appellant’s wife became ill in Canada with bronchial asthma.

REASONS FOR DECISION





INTRODUCTION

[1] These are the reasons for the decision in th e appeal by [REDACTED] (“a ppellant”)

from a negative determination made by an immigration officer that the Appellant did not comply

with the residency obligation prescribed in section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection

Act (IRPA ).

[2] Section 28 of IRPA states:

28. (1) Residency obligation --A permanent resident must comply with a residency

obligation with respect to every five -year period.



(2) Application --The following provisions govern the residency obligation under

subsection (1):

(a) a permanent resident complies with the residency obligation with respect

to a five -year period if, on each of a total of at least 730 days in that five -year

period, they are

(i) physically present i n Canada, ...

[3] Section 28 of IRPA requires a permanent resident of Canada to be physically present in

Canada for at least 730 days in the five -year period immediately prior to their application for a

travel document. The visa of ficer determined that the a ppellant was physically present in Canada

for only 104 days during the five year period preceding June 26, 2014, the date of his application

for a travel document.1

Protection Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection. She has not submitte d new

evidence in support of her appeal. The Appellant asks that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)

Appellant requests that the RAD refer the matter back to the RPD with a differently -constituted

panel.

DE TERMINATION

person in need of protection. This appeal is dismissed.

REASONS FOR DECISION

INTRODUCTION

[1] These are the reasons in the appeal of Prince D[REDACTED] (appellant) from a

determination of a visa officer in Canada concerning his failure to comply with the residency

obligation set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA ).1

[2] Section 28 of the IRPA requires a permanent resident to be physically present in Canada

for at least 730 days in the five -year period immediately before he applies for a travel document.

An immigration officer found that the appellant had spent insufficient time in Canada and would

be unable to comply with the legislation .

[3] The visa officer also held that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate

(H&C) considerations, taking into account the best interests of the child, to justify the breach of

the residency obligation and the appellant’s retention of his permanent resident status.

ISSUE

[4] The appellant does not challenge the legal validity of the visa off icer’s decision but

argues that the appeal should be allowed on the basis that sufficient H&C considerations exist to

warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.

DECISION

[5] Having considered the evidence and submissions, the panel has come to the conclusion

that the officer’s determination of the contravention of the residency obligation is valid in law .

[6] The panel further finds that there are sufficient H&C considerations to warrant special

relief, in light of all the circumstances of the case.

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] The Appellant, [REDACTED] is an 18 -year -old man from India but grew up in Kuwait

since he was an infant because his parents worked there. The Appellant and his parents landed in

Canada in April 2005 when he was three and a half years old . They left Kuwait because of

political inst ability. The Appellant and his parents stayed in Canada for 11 days and returned to

Kuwait because the political situation had improved.

[2] In February 2019, when the Appellant was 17 years old, he applied for his permanent

resident travel document (PRTD) b ecause he wanted to return to Canada to study. In July 2019,

the visa officer denied the Appellant ’s application because he had not met his residency

obligations ---the Appellant had not been physically in Canada for the past 5 years. Permanent

residents (PR) are required to be in Canada for at least 730 in any five -year period in order to

maintain their PR status. At the time when the Appellant applied for his PRTD, he had not

returned to Canada since he had left at the age of three and a half years old.

[3] The Appellant admits that he has not met his residency obligation and appeals the matter

on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds in order for him to maintain his PR status.

[4] In August 2019, the Appellant came to Canada through a land border. Current ly, the

Appellant lives and studies in Canada.

[5] The Appellant ’s position is that the appeal should be allowed because it was not his

parents’ choice, and not his, to leave Canada; he is now established in Canada and he will suffer

hardship if the appeal is dismissed. In contrast, the Minister’s position is that the appeal should

be dismissed because the Appellant has not provided sufficient H&C grounds to overcome the

significant breach.

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] A permanent resident (“PR”) of Canada is required to be physically present in Canada for

at least 730 days in a 5 -year period or fall into one of the exceptions permitted in the legislation.

Yandu[REDACTED] (“the appellant”) is a 41 -year -old citizen of Cuba who app lied for

her Permanent Resident Travel Document (PRTD) on March 21, 2018 in Havana. The appellant

indicated in her Permanent Resident Travel Document application that she had been physically

present in Canada for zero days in the five years preceding Marc h 21, 2018 (“the period”). The

visa officer who examined the appellant's PRTD application refused it on April 12, 2018, as the

appellant did not meet the requirements of section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection

Act (“the Act ”), and indeed had last been physically present in Canada in October 2009. The visa

officer noted that in the 5 -year period prior to the application, the appellant had zero days of

physical presence in Canada, but the officer did consider whether time spent with her Canadia n

citizen spouse in Cuba would count toward her residency obligation. Even if this time was

included, however, it would only amount to 252 days in the five -year period, and the appellant

was still in breach of the residency obligation. The appellant appe aled the decision of the visa

officer on May 16, 2018, and this is the decision in her appeal.



HEARING



[2] At the hearing, the appellant was present over the telephone. She was represented by

counsel at the first sitting, and her husband and daughter attend ed the hearing as witnesses.

Unfortunately, due to the difficulty in telephoning in and out of Cuba, the hearing did not

conclude and the second sitting was required. At the second sitting, the appellant’s husband

advised that he had fired their counsel and that he would be representin...</div>

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

“French version edited for spelling, syntax and grammar ”

INTRODUCTION

[1] This is an oral decision in the case concerning the appellant ,

[REDACTED] SILVA , a citizen of Brazil , who is appealing against a decision made on

November 12, 2015, at a port of entry , and the fact that the appellant could not comply with his

residency obligation of being present in Canada for a minimum of 730 days during the five -year

period in question, from February 4, 2012, the date when the appellant became a permanent

resident, until February 4, 2017. In fact, on the date of the decision at the port of entry, that is,

November 12, 2015, the appellant had been present in Canada for approximately 30 days.

Following the depart ure order, the tendency of being absent from Canada changed considerably,

and he has spent most of his time in Canada since the order was issued in 2015. The appellant is

not challenging the legal validity of the decision. He is requesting that the panel consider the

various humanitarian and comp assionate considerations in his case.



[2] Considering the appellant’s position and the evidence in the case, the panel concludes

that the officer’s decision is valid in law. Now, concerning the humanitarian and compassionate

aspects, the panel is guided by the jurisprudence, specifically, the factors that have been

established since Bufete Arce .1 The main factors to consider are the extent of the non -compliance

with the residency obligation, the initial and continuing degree of establishment in Canada , the

reasons for departure from Canada, whether reasonable attempts to return to Can ada were made

and the hardship and dislocation that could be cause d to the appellant and his family members by

a dismissal and, cert ainly, the best interests of any minor child directly affected by this decision

and any other factor s that could be relevant and co...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and decision of the Immigrati on Appeal Division (IAD) in the

appeal by [REDACTED] BIGO (Appellant) from a removal order made against h er on

September 12, 2019 .1 The Appellant was found to be inadmissible on the basis of failing to

comply with the residency obligation requirements of section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee

Protection Act (Act ).2





BACKGROUND



[2] The Appellant is a citizen of the Sudan. The Appellant was granted refugee status and

then became a permanent resident in February 2005.3



[3] The Appellant was married in Canada i n 2008 and has four children that were born in

Canada.4



[4] The Appellant testified at the hearing and no additional documentary evidence was

provided.





ANALYSIS



[5] There was no challenge to the legal validity of the removal order. Based on the evidence

befor e me , the removal order is valid in law as the Appellant has not met her residency

obligation requirements under section 28 of the Act.



2019 CanLII 131528 (CA IRB)

IAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAI : VB9 -07207











[6] However, the IAD has discretionary jurisdiction to permit an Appellant to retain their

permanent resident status despi te a breach of the residency obligation. The test is that the IAD

must be satisfied at the time that the appeal is disposed of, taking into account the best interest of

any child directly affected by the decision whether there are sufficient humanitarian a nd

compassionate considerations that warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the

case.



[7] The Appellant testified in the usual areas that are considered by the IAD in the exercise

of its discretionary jurisdiction. At the conclusion of t he evidence the Minister’s counsel

recommended that the appeal be allowed on the basis there are sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations tha...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION

INTRODUCTION

[1] [REDACTED] (the appellant) filed an application under section 71 of the

Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act ) to reopen his appeal. The Respon dent opposes

this application which is decided in chambers pursuant to section 25 of the Immigration Appeal

Division Rules.

ANALYSIS

[2] The Immigration Appeal Division ( IAD ) may reopen an appeal pursuant to section 71 of

the Act which states the following:

Reopening appeal

71 The Immigration Appeal Division, on an application by a foreign national who has not left

Canada under a removal order, may reopen an appeal if it is satisfied that it failed to observe a

principle of natural justice.

[3] The appellant was sc heduled for a reconsideration of his appeal (stay) on May 31, 2018, on

a peremptory basis. This matter had been postponed on numerous occasions. On the day of his

reconsideration, the appellant failed to appear despite the presence of his counsel. Accordin gly,

IAD M ember [REDACTED] dismissed the appeal. Here are the reasons contained in the last 2

paragraphs of his reasons:

Given the appellant has been aware of his reconsideration appeal hearing and was

counselled by this Panel on January 29, 2018, about the importance of appearing before

the IAD with respect to his stay reconsideration, as well as to ensure compliance with any

possible stay order extensions, the fact that he failed to appear suggests that he is no

longer pursing his appeal and recognizes that he will be eventually removed to Guyana.

Accordingly, the Panel sees no other alternative other than to dismiss the appellant’s

appeal for lack of interest. The appeal is hereby dismissed pursuant to subsection 69(1) of

the IRPA .
