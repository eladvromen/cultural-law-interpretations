IAD File No. / N° de dossier de la SAI : VA9-03559 / 60 / 61 / 62

1 REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] These are the reasons for the decisions in the appeals of [REDACTED] [VA9-03559], [REDACTED] [VA9-03560], [REDACTED] [VA9-03561], and [REDACTED] [VA9- 03562] (the appellants) from removal orders made against them on June 17, 2009 by the Immigration Division (the ID) of the Immigr ation and Refugee Board. The ID issued the removal orders on the ground that [REDACTED] was a person described in subsection 41(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).

1 In particular, he did not comply with the conditions imposed on his as required by subsection 27(2) of the Act. The other appellants were accompanying family members of [REDACTED] and hence are also inadmissible due to his failure to comply. ISSUE [2] The appellants do not challenge to the legal validity of the removal orders and, based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the re moval orders are valid in law. The issue before the panel is whether the appeals should be allowed on the basis that sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the cases, taking into account the best interests of any child directly affected by the decision. [3] The appellants became permanent resident under the provisions of the former Immigration Act (the former Act)

2 and subparagraphs 23(1)(i)(a) through (d) of the former Immigration Regulations (the former Regulations).

3 These appeals are being determined in accordance with the transitional provisions of the Act. DECISION [REDACTED] [VA9-03559] [4] I have come to the conclusion that the removal order is valid in law and that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds, in light of all the circumstances of the case,

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the “Principal Appellant”), [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] (the “Spousal Appellant”) and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the “Minor Appellant”) are

citizens of Nigeria and are appealing a dec ision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD)

denying their claims for refugee protection.

[2] The Minor Appellant is the daughter of the Principal Appellant and Spousal Appellant.

The Principal and Spousal Appellants also have a son named [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] , who was born in Canada and is a Canadian citizen and not an Appellant in this case . The

Principal Appellant was named as the Designated Representative (DR) of the Minor Appellant at

the RPD hearing and the RAD confirms this designation.

[3] The Appellan ts are requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the

RPD’s negative determination and find that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the “appellant”), a national of Ethiopia , appeals a decision of the

Refugee Protection Division (the “RPD”) rejecting her claim for refugee protection.



DETERMINATION OF THE AP PEAL



[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the

“Act ”),1 the Refugee Appeal Division (the “ RAD ”) orders that the determination of the RPD that

the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of pr otection be set aside and

that the matter be returned to the RPD for redetermination by a different RPD Member without

further instruction. The appeal is allowed.



BACKGROUND



[3] In her claim for refugee protection, the appellant alleged that she and her Cana dian born

daughter would be persecuted by her parents in law if they were to return to Ethiopia. The

appellant alleged that her husband’s family insists that her daughter be circumcised. The

appellant refuses to allow this. However, while her husband is al so opposed to his daughter’s

circumcision, he is allegedly unable to oppose his parents out of respect for tradition.



[4] The appellant alleged that the threat of her daughter’s circumcision represents a form of

persecution as she fears that her refusal to a llow this and to have stayed in Canada without her

in-laws permission will result in severe punishment for her. She also alleged that the prospect of

circumcision for her Canadian born daughter represents a form of psychological persecution for

her .

2015 CanLII 105868 (CA IRB)

RAD F ile No. / N° de dossier de la SA R :

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (the Appellant) appeals a decision of

the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) accepting the claim for refugee protection of [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the Respondent ), a male from Nigeria. The Minister has submitted new evidence

in support of the appeal that was not presented at the RPD hearing.

DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL

[2] Pursuant to ss. 111 (1) (b) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA ), the

Refugee Appeal Division ( RAD ) sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes the

determination that [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] is neith er a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the

IRPA nor a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97 of IRPA. Pursuant to ss. 107(2) of

IRPA, the RAD finds that there is no credible basis for the claim and that it is manifestly

unfounded. This Appeal is allowed.

BACKGROUND

[3] The Respondent, [REDACTED] , alleged before the RPD that he is a gay man and

was involved in a sexual relationship with another man. The Respondent in the Addendum to his

Basis of Claim form (BOC) states that he engaged in a he terosexual relationship with one other

person of the opposite sex in Nigeria in an attempt to camouflage his true sexual orientation.

[4] The Respondent alleges that on [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , 2013 while he was going home, he was

stopped by an unknown person who advised [REDACTED] not to go home, as there was police looking for

him, and that there had been a killing in the neighbourhood. The unknown person told the

Respondent to hide; the Respondent later learnt that the person killed was his fiancé, [REDACTED] . The

Respondent alleges that the assailants were either police officers or individuals purported to be

the same.

[5] The Respondent further alleges that this unknown man took him to a restaurant where he

left t...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION

[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal of [REDACTED] (the

appellant) from a removal order made against him on September 26 , 2017 , because of his failure

to comply with the residency obligation set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1

(the Act ).

[2] Section 28 of the Act requires a permanent resident to be physically present in Canada for

at least 730 days in the five -year period immediately prior to an assessment, which in this case

five years after the appellant’s landing date of June 15, 2014.

[3] The appellant does not challenge the legal validity of the removal order but argues that

the appeal should b e allowed on the basis that sufficient humanitarian and compassionate

considerations warrant special relief, in light of all the circumstances of the case, taking into

account the best interests of any child directly affected by the decision.

[4] I have consi dered the testimony of the appellant, his daughter and his friend, the Appeal

Record and the documents filed by the appellant2 and the respondent’s and the written

submissions3 of the respondent who participated to the appeal with written submissions.

DECI SION

[5] The appellant did not dispute the legal validity of the breach of the residency obligation.

The appellant, at the time of the control had been present in Canada for 66 days during the

relevant five -year period. If he had stayed in Canada after the dat e of the control and the removal

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] (the Appellant), a citizen of Ghana, appeals a decision of the Refugee

Protection Division (RPD) rejecting her claim for refugee protection.

[2] The Appellant submit ted documents to be considered as new evidence pursuant to

s.110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act or IRPA) in support of her

appeal. However, the Appellant did not request a hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division

(RAD) pursuant to section 1 10 (6) of the Act.

[3] The Appellant requests that the RAD set aside the RPD’s decision and remit the matter

back to the RPD for redetermination. In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the RAD grant

any other order that the Division deems reasona ble and expedient having regard to the peculiar

facts and circumstances of this case.

DETERMINATION

[4] Pursuant to Section 111(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the

RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neithe r a Convention refugee (CR)

nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.

[5] This appeal is dismissed.

Background:

[6] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that her husband’s famil y members want to carry

out female circumcision (female genital mutilation) on her infant daughter who was born in

Canada on [REDACTED], 2014. [REDACTED] and her husband oppose this practice. The Appellant is

afraid that she would personally face serious harm, torture or death due to her op posi tion to this

practice. The A ppellant’s husband remains in Ghana and he does not believe that he could protect

his wife or daughter in these circumstances. The Appellant also alleged that all female family

members of her husband have undergone this procedur e and her father -in-law in particular wishes

to preserve this custom .

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW



[1] The Appellant, [REDACTED], is a widowed 73 -year -old British national overseas and

a Chinese citizen who lives in Hong Kong.1 She appeal s a February 2021 decisio n that she did not

compl y with the residency obligation as a permanent resident (PR) .2

[2] To comply with the residency obligation, a PR must be physically present in Canada for

730 days in a five -year period.3 The Appellant concedes that she was present in Canada for zero

days in the relevant five -year period. As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.

[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate ( H&C ) considerations

warrant special relief in the Appellant’s case.4 I find that they do. The appeal is allowed.

[4] In 1994, the [REDACTED] landed in Canada with her spouse and their two children.5 Their

son stayed in Canada with the [REDACTED]’s brother. The Appellant, her spouse, and t heir daughter

returned to Hong Kong. They intended to settle permanently in Canada in 1995 or 1996 after

winding up her spouse’s business in Hong Kong. The Appellant, her spouse, and their daughter

returned to Canada in 1995 to visit their son. The [REDACTED] nt’s spouse experienced health concerns

during those long -haul flights. Consequently, he refused to travel anywhere after 1995. The

Appellant stayed in Hong Kong with her spouse because she felt this was her role as “a traditional

Chinese wife.” She travel ed to Canada regularly until 2013 on her own. After 2013, her spouse’s

health deteriorated, and she could no longer leave him to travel to Canada. He died in Hong Kong

in September 2018. In April 2019, the [REDACTED]’s daughter had surgery in Hong Kong . In mid -

2019, the [REDACTED]’s son learned that the Appellant could apply for a PR travel document. At

that time, a proposed extradition bill caused protests and di...</div>

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

[French version e dited for spelling, grammar and syntax]

OVERVIEW

[1] You, [REDACTED] , are the appellant. You are a citizen of Algeria and a permanent

resident of Canada.

[2] Permanent residents of Canada must comply with a residency obligation. One of the ways

to comply with it is to have spent a sufficient number of days in Canada.

[3] To be able to enter Canada, you applied for a permanent resident travel document. This

application was received by the Canadian immigration authorities on August 8, 2019 . An

immigration officer refused this application because he concluded that you had not complied with

your residency obligation. This is the decision being appealed before me. Your appeal is based on

subsection 63(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protectio n Act , which I will refer to simply as the

Act.

[4] You admit that you did not comply with your residency obligation. However, you are

asking that you r appeal be allowed based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The

Minister’s representative is request ing that your appeal be dismissed.

[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities, requiring that

allegations are more likely than not to be true .

[6] I conclude that you failed to comply with your residency obligation. I also conclude that

there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations. I will refer to

paragraph 67(1)(c) of the Act. This paragraph states that an appeal is allowed if, taking into

account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and

compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.

[7] Given that I conclude that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate

considerations, the appeal is d ismissed.
