The ID issued the removal orders on the ground that [REDACTED] was a person described in subsection 41(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u0093Act\u0094).\n\n1 In particular, he did not comply with the conditions imposed on his as required by subsection 27(2) of the Act. The other appellants were accompanying family members of [REDACTED] and hence are also inadmissible due to his failure to comply. ISSUE [2] The appellants do not challenge to the legal validity of the removal orders and, based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the re moval orders are valid in law. The issue before the panel is whether the appeals should be allowed on the basis that sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the cases, taking into account the best interests of any child directly affected by the decision. [3] The appellants became permanent resident under the provisions of the former Immigration Act (the \u0093former Act\u0094)\n\n2 and subparagraphs 23(1)(i)(a) through (d) of the former Immigration Regulations (the \u0093former Regulations\u0094).\n\n3 These appeals are being determined in accordance with the transitional provisions of the Act. DECISION [REDACTED] [VA9-03559] [4] I have come to the conclusion that the removal order is valid in law and that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds, in light of all the circumstances of the case,\n\n\n\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n2 Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.I-2 as amended.\n\n3 Immigration Regulations, 1..."

The Minister has submitted new evidence\n\nin support of the appeal that was not presented at the RPD hearing.\n\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n\n[2] Pursuant to ss. 111 (1) (b) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA ), the\n\nRefugee Appeal Division ( RAD ) sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes the\n\ndetermination that [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] is neith er a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the\n\nIRPA nor a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97 of IRPA.

The unknown person told the\n\nRespondent to hide; the Respondent later learnt that the person killed was his fianc\u00e9, [REDACTED] . The\n\nRespondent alleges that the assailants were either police officers or individuals purported to be\n\nthe same.\n\n[5] The Respondent further alleges that this unknown man took him to a restaurant where he\n\nleft t..."

As such, the validity of the decision is not in dispute.\n\n[3] The issue in this appeal is whether humanitarian and compassionate ( H&C ) considerations\n\nwarrant special relief in the Appellant\u2019s case.4 I find that they do. The appeal is allowed.\n\n[4] In 1994, the [REDACTED] landed in Canada with her spouse and their two children.5 Their\n\nson stayed in Canada with the [REDACTED]\u2019s brother. The Appellant, her spouse, and t heir daughter\n\nreturned to Hong Kong. They intended to settle permanently in Canada in 1995 or 1996 after\n\nwinding up her spouse\u2019s business in Hong Kong. The Appellant, her spouse, and their daughter\n\nreturned to Canada in 1995 to visit their son. The [REDACTED] nt\u2019s spouse experienced health concerns\n\nduring those long -haul flights. Consequently, he refused to travel anywhere after 1995. The\n\nAppellant stayed in Hong Kong with her spouse because she felt this was her role as \u201ca traditional\n\nChinese wife.\u201d She travel ed to Canada regularly until 2013 on her own. After 2013, her spouse\u2019s\n\nhealth deteriorated, and she could no longer leave him to travel to Canada. He died in Hong Kong\n\nin September 2018. In April 2019, the [REDACTED]\u2019s daughter had surgery in Hong Kong . In mid -\n\n2019, the [REDACTED]\u2019s son learned that the Appellant could apply for a PR travel document.

You are a citizen of Algeria and a permanent\n\nresident of Canada.\n\n[2] Permanent residents of Canada must comply with a residency obligation. One of the ways\n\nto comply with it is to have spent a sufficient number of days in Canada.\n\n[3] To be able to enter Canada, you applied for a permanent resident travel document. This\n\napplication was received by the Canadian immigration authorities on August 8, 2019 . An\n\nimmigration officer refused this application because he concluded that you had not complied with\n\nyour residency obligation. This is the decision being appealed before me. Your appeal is based on\n\nsubsection 63(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protectio n Act , which I will refer to simply as the\n\nAct.\n\n[4] You admit that you did not comply with your residency obligation. However, you are\n\nasking that you r appeal be allowed based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The\n\nMinister\u2019s representative is request ing that your appeal be dismissed.\n\n[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities, requiring that\n\nallegations are more likely than not to be true .\n\n[6] I conclude that you failed to comply with your residency obligation. I also conclude that\n\nthere are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations. I will refer to\n\nparagraph 67(1)(c) of the Act. This paragraph states that an appeal is allowed if, taking into\n\naccount the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and\n\ncompassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.\n\n[7] Given that I conclude that there are not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate\n\nconsiderations, the appeal is d ismissed.\n\n\n\n2021 CanLII 81259..."
