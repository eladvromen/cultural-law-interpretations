IAD.34.01 (2021. 11.24)

Available in French REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellant, Veroni[REDACTED], is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. She

became a permanent resident of Canada in 2012. After landing in Canada, the A ppellant stayed

here for about two months. She returned to Trinidad and Tobago to wrap up her affairs. Later, her

parents became ill, which prevented her from retuning back to Canada sooner.

[2] In 2020, the Appellant applied for a Permanent Resident Travel D ocument to return to

Canada, but the visa officer refused her application. The Appellant did not respect her residency

obligations to be present in Canada in the relevant five -year period for at least 730 days.1 In the

relevant five -year period, she was pr esent for only 136 days.

[3] The Appellant appealed the visa officer’s decision to the Immigration Appeal Division. She

admitted that the visa officer ’s decision is legally valid. She is relying on humanitarian and

compassionate reasons for the appeal to be allowed.

[4] The Appellant’s hearing was scheduled for three hours on June 18, 2021. I heard testimony

from the Appellant, but we were not able to finish the hearing that day. I adjourned the matter for

November 8, 2021, for a full day , to continue the hearing.

[5] In a letter dated November 3, 2021, the Appellant asked to withdraw her appeal. The

Minister submits that the withdrawal of the appeal is an abuse of process and asks that the appeal

be dismissed.2

[6] The issues are:

 Is the Appellan t’s application to withdraw her appeal an abuse of process?

 If I determine the withdrawal is an abuse of process , should the appeal be

dismissed on its merits or abandoned ?

[7] The Appellant’s application to withdraw her appeal is an abuse of process. I dismi ss the

Appellant’s application. I find that the appeal has been...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISI ON



[1] These are the reasons and decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (the “IAD”) in

the appeal by [REDACTED] (the “ principal a ppellant”) , his wife [REDACTED] and his

daughter [REDACTED] from a determination made against them on May 3, 2013. The a ppel lant s

were found to have failed to comply with the residency obligation of section 28 of the

Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the “ Act ”),1 more particularly that the appellant s had

not resided in Canada for at least 730 days in the five -year period immediately before February

27, 2013.



ISSUE



[2] The appellant s did not challenge the legal validity of the determination . The appellants

became permanent residents of Canada in August 2001. The appellants were not physically

present in Canada in the five -year period between February 28, 2008 and February 27, 2013. The

appellants asked that I exercise my discretionary jurisdiction and allow the appeals on

humanitarian and compassionate considerations.



[3] The relevant paragraph of s ection 28 of the Act reads as follows:



28 (1) “A permanent resident must comply with a residency obligation with

respect to every five -year period.

(2) The following provisions govern the residency obligation under subsection (1):

(a) a permanent resident complies with the residency obli gation with

respect to a five -year period if, on each of a total of at least 730 days

in that five -year period, they are

(i) physically present in Canada,… ”



[4] The test to be applied in the exercise of discretionary jurisdiction is that the IAD must be

satis fied at the time the appeal is disposed of, taking into account the best interests of a child

directly affected by the decision, there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate

considerations that warrant special relief in light of all the circumstance s of the case. Prior

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) in the

appeals by J ahan[REDACTED], [REDACTED], Yasa [REDACTED]

and Naza[REDACTED] (the Appellants), from determinations made against them on

September 10, 2018. The Appellants were found to have failed to comply with the residency

obligation requirements in section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Act ).1 The

determinations that the Appellants breached the residency obligation were made outside Canada.





BACKGROUND



[2] The Appellants were landed in Canada in July 2012 with the Appellant Mr. [REDACTED] as a skilled worke r.2



[3] The Appellant Mr. [REDACTED] testified at the hearing on behalf of all the Appellants.

The Appellant Ms. Yasa[REDACTED] also provide some testimony and submissions.

Minister’s counsel provided written submission dated July 16, 2019.



[4] Additional documentary evidence was submitted.3





ANALYSIS



[5] The Appellants were physically present in Canada for less than 200 days in the relevant

five year period, between September 6, 2013 and September 5, 2018.4 Based on the evidence

before me, the Ap pellants have not met the residency obligation requirements under section 28

of the Act. Therefore , I find the determinations are valid in law.



[6] Pursuant to paragraph 67(1)(c) of the Act the IAD has been granted authority to consider

discretionary relief a nd permit appellants to retain their permanent resident status despite a

breach of the residency obligation. The test to be applied in the exercise of discretionary

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

“French version edited for spelling, syntax and grammar ”

INTRODUCTION

[1] This is an oral decision in the case concerning the appellant ,

[REDACTED] SILVA , a citizen of Brazil , who is appealing against a decision made on

November 12, 2015, at a port of entry , and the fact that the appellant could not comply with his

residency obligation of being present in Canada for a minimum of 730 days during the five -year

period in question, from February 4, 2012, the date when the appellant became a permanent

resident, until February 4, 2017. In fact, on the date of the decision at the port of entry, that is,

November 12, 2015, the appellant had been present in Canada for approximately 30 days.

Following the depart ure order, the tendency of being absent from Canada changed considerably,

and he has spent most of his time in Canada since the order was issued in 2015. The appellant is

not challenging the legal validity of the decision. He is requesting that the panel consider the

various humanitarian and comp assionate considerations in his case.



[2] Considering the appellant’s position and the evidence in the case, the panel concludes

that the officer’s decision is valid in law. Now, concerning the humanitarian and compassionate

aspects, the panel is guided by the jurisprudence, specifically, the factors that have been

established since Bufete Arce .1 The main factors to consider are the extent of the non -compliance

with the residency obligation, the initial and continuing degree of establishment in Canada , the

reasons for departure from Canada, whether reasonable attempts to return to Can ada were made

and the hardship and dislocation that could be cause d to the appellant and his family members by

a dismissal and, cert ainly, the best interests of any minor child directly affected by this decision

and any other factor s that could be relevant and co...</div>

1 REASONS FOR DECISIO N

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellants, Qu[REDACTED] [REDACTED] are married.

Their minor son, [REDACTED] , is also an Appellant. The Appellants are all citizens

of Vietnam and permanent residents of Canada.

[2] Permanent residents of Canada have a residency obligation. One of the ways to comply

with this obligation is to spend a certain number of days in C anada.

[3] The Appellants are all in Vietnam. Their permanent resident cards are expired. Therefore,

they each applied for a permanent resident travel document. Their applications were all received

on June 18, 2020.

[4] An immigration officer refused the Appellants’ applications. The officer found that they

had not complied with their residency obligation. The officer also found that there were not

sufficient humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) considerations to overcome the lack of

compliance. The Appell ants are appealing the officer’s decision.1

[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities. This means what is

more probable than not.

[6] The appeals are allowed. The A ppellants did not comply with their residency obligation.

However, I conclude that there are enough H&C considerations to overcome their non -

compliance.

ANALYSIS

The Appellants did not comply with their residency obligation

[7] The Appellants became permanent residents in 2014. They needed to be physically

present in Canada fo r a total of at least 730 days over a five -year period.2 In this case, the

relevant five -year period is from June 18, 2015, to June 18, 2020. Mr. and Ms. [REDACTED] were

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellants are [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“the Principal Appellant ”), his wife

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] ”), their minor son [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“[REDACTED] ”), and their minor daughter [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

(“[REDACTED] ”). The Principal Appellant, Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , and [REDACTED] are Nigerian

citizens. [REDACTED] was born in the United States and is therefore an American citizen. The

Appellants fear political persecution in Nigeria due to the Principal Appellant’s involvement i n

the All Progressives Congress (“APC”) . The Appellants fear that members of the People’ s

Democratic Party (“PDP”) will seek to harm them . The Refugee Protection Division (“RPD”)

rejected the Appella nts’ claims . The RPD identified problems with the credibility of the Principal

Appellant’s testimony. The panel appeared to accept the facts around the Principal Appellant’s

political activities , but it determined that there was a viable internal flight alternative (“IFA”) in

Abuja. The Appellants dispute this decision and provide new evidence that addresses the RPD’s

findings.

[2] The result of this appeal is a split decision . A claim against the United Sta tes was not

advanced for [REDACTED] at the RPD, nor have the Appellants disputed the RPD’s reasons for

rejecting her claim. No risks have been identified for [REDACTED] in the United States that would

entitle her to refugee protection . The Refugee Appeal Division (“RAD”) therefore a gree s with

the RPD’s reasons for rejecting her claim. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)( a) of the Immigration

and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”), the appeal in regard to [REDACTED] claim is dismissed.

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are the reasons and de cision of the Immigration Appeal Division (the “IAD”) in

the appeal by [REDACTED] (the “appellant”) from a determination made against her on

February 4, 2016. The appellant was found to have failed to comply with the residency

obligation of section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the “ Act ”),1 more

particularly that the appellant had not resided in Canada for at least 730 days in the five -year

period immediately before February 1, 2016.



ISSUE



[2] The appellant did not challenge the lega l validity of the determination. The appellant

became a permanent resident of Canada, at the age of 25, in April 2009. She was a dependant of

her parents. The appellant conceded that she was not physically present in Canada in the five -

year period February 1, 2011 to Janu ary 31 , 2016. The appellant asked that I exercise my

discretionary jurisdiction and allow the appeal on humanitarian and compassionate

considerations.



[3] The relevant paragraph of s ection 28 of the Act reads as follows:



28(1) A permanent res ident must comply with a residency obligation with respect to

every five -year period.

(2) The following provisions govern the residency obligation under subsection (1):

(a) a permanent resident complies with the residency obligation with

respect to a five -year period if, on each of a total of at least 730 days in that

five -year period, they are

(i) physically present in Canada,…

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal s of [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] (the appellants) , who appeal ed from a determin ation that they breached the

residency obligation.

ISSUE

[2] The five -year period under consideration is from July 5, 2010 to July 5, 2015. The parties

agreed that the appellants were in the country for only 249 days during the five -year period. This

is only 34 percent compliance. The visa officer’s determination is legally valid . T he appellants

are asking f or special relief on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds.

HUMANITARIAN AND COMPASSIONATE GROUNDS

[3] I heard testimony from the appellant , Mr. [REDACTED] . Based on the testimony, the Minister’s

counsel recommended the appeal s be allowed for the reasons that follows .

[4] Mr. [REDACTED] and his wife landed in July , 2009. We heard testimony that the appellants

returned to Iran because Mr. [REDACTED] had not yet retired from his job , and their second son was in

university in Iran at the time . Given the ties they stil l had to Iran, the appellants return ed in order

to wind up their affairs , and to prepare for a late r stage of their life and retirement. Such is the

reason for their departure from Canada .

[5] The reason the appellants extended their stay abroad was because Mr. [REDACTED] ’s father

had heart problems in 2011 , and suffered from a stroke . Since Mr. [REDACTED] was a medical doctor,

he remained in Iran to take care of his father , as he felt that he was in the best position to do so ,

given his training as a medical doctor.

[6] Mr. [REDACTED] has a brother and three sisters in Teheran ; since his father is now recovered,

he testified that his siblings are able to assume the responsibility of the care of their father. The

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the claimant) is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Communist regime and in particular, the Public Security Bureau, by reason of his political opinion as a Falun Gong practitioner. In addition, he claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a dange r of torture in the People's Republic of China. ALLEGATIONS: The claimant alleges that he started to practice Falun Gong in [REDACTED] 2003 in order to improve his health. The claimant stated that on [REDACTED], 2003, the Public Security Bureau raided his Falun Gong practice group. The claimant stated that he was not present at the time but was advised to go into hiding, which he did. The claimant indicated that he learned, while in hiding, that the Public Security Bureau had come to his home, looking to arrest him. The claimant made arrangements to leave the country and arrived in Canada on [REDACTED], 2003. DETERMINATION: I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

2 ANALYSIS: Identity: The claimant’s oral testimony, the supporting documentation

2 establish his identity as a national of the People's Republic of China. I find that the Public Security Bureau is not, nor has ever been, interested in arresting the claimant. The claimant maintained that the Public Security Bureau went to his home on more than one occasion, looking to arrest him. The claimant stated that he left the People's Republic of China with his own genuine passport via the Beijing Airport. It was put to the claimant that the country documentation

REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] The following are the reasons regarding the appeal of Mr. Ragheb [REDACTED] (the appellant), a citizen of Syria, who is appealing a decision which was rendered

by an immigration officer at Pierre -Elliott -Trudeau International Airport on December 30th,

2013, which concludes that the appellant did not respect his residency obligation of being in

Canada for a minimum of 730 days during the five -year referen ce period preceding the decision

which was taken on December 30, 2013.1 Per the decision, it appears that the appellant would

have been in Canada for about 400 days during the five -year reference period.



[2] The appellant is not contesting the legal validity of this decision, as such by considering

this and the evidence on file, the tribunal finds that this decision is valid in law. Instead the

appellant is asking that special measures be taken by considering the applicable humani tarian

and compassionate grounds in this case. The applicable factors have evolved greatly over the

years and have been established in several decisions such as Bufete Arce2 which provide a list of

several non -exhaustive factors, notably:



 The degree of the non -compliance of the residency obligation.

 The reasons for the departure from Canada and the reasons of a continued and lengthy stay

abroad.

 The degree of establishment in Canada, initially and at the time of the hearing.

 The family ties in Canada

 Whether attempts to return to Canada were made at the first reasonable opportunity.

 The hardship that would be caused to the appellant and his family members in Canada if

this app eal is dismissed.

 The best interests of any child directly affected by this decision.

 Whether there are other unique or special circumstances which would be applicable.

Oral Reasons for Decision

[1] This is the decision in file number MA6-07938 in the appeal by [REDACTED] (the appellant) from a deportation order made agai nst him on October 26, 2006 for the reason that he would be a permanent resident inadmissible for fa iling to comply with the residency obligation of section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).

1 [2] The appeal proceeded this morning with the testim ony of the appellant with and in presence of his wife and three of his four children. As I wa s giving this decision, Mr. [REDACTED] left the room for medical reasons but nevertheless the Panel had already arrived at a decision and, it was understood before he left with the ambulance that I would be proceeding to give a positive decision from the Bench. The appellant’s wife is here in the room with us. Facts [3] The facts of this matter can be summarized as follows. Mr. [REDACTED] is a permanent resident of Canada, of Palestinian origin, and is therefore stat eless. There is no country of citizenship. Before coming to Canada, he lived in Dubai, a nation whic h does not confer status on foreign nationals who worked in that country. Mr. [REDACTED] is an engineer by profession and his professional contracts were in Dubai. When he came to Canada, it was made clear to him that he would require two years of university training to receive the Canadian equiva lencies in his profession. As he had a wife AND three children, the fourth child being born in Cana da and being therefore a Canadian citizen, he elected to set up his profession in such a way that he could profit from his contacts in Dubai and work from Canada preparing plans for major construction projects in Dubai. [4] His documentary evidence shows that he has always filed his revenue reports with Canadian tax authorities and thus reported his annual reve nues as required by our tax laws. His wif...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION

Introduction [1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal, pursuant to subsection 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

(IRPA ) of T[REDACTED] (the principal appellant), his wife, [REDACTED] (the appellant) and E[REDACTED] (the minor appellant). They are appealing the de termination by the Minister’s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA

, because the Minister’s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA

. [2] Specifically, the appellants had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five- year period immediately after they became permanent residents, which was on March 27, 2003. The Minister’s Delegate was also not sati sfied, pursuant to section 28(2)(c) of IRPA

, that there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate c onsiderations, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the determination, to justify retention of permanent resident status and overcome the breach of the residency obligations. Background



[3] The principal appellant is 44 years old. He was born on July 18, 1963 in Kuwait, but he is a citizen of Lebanon. His wife is 38 years old and a citizen of Lebanon. His son, E[REDACTED], is 9 years old and a citizen of Le banon. There is a second son, [REDACTED], who is 7 years old. He is not an appellant in this appeal. [4] The family came to Canada as permanent re sidents on March 27, 2003. They left Canada and returned to Kuwait on April 12, 2003, when the principal appellant’s wife became ill in Canada with bronchial asthma. The principal appellant returned on March 2, 2006 and remained

NOTICE OF DECISION AND REASONS

[1] Ravj[REDACTED] (the appellant) was granted permanent resident status to Canada on April 30, 1996 as an assisted relative. His wife and three children were to follow him to Canada. [2] The appellant returned to India in January 1997 because of his wife's ill health. He submitted his Indian passport and his immigration vi sa (assumedly his record of landing) to the immigration section of the Canadian High Comm ission in New Delhi, India in January 1997 for the purpose of obtaining a returning resident's permit under the provisions of the former Immigration Act. His visa and passport were lost or stol en at either the New Delhi visa office or in the mail. The appellant's request for a re turning resident permit was not granted. The appellant's passport and visa were returned to him by the visa office 10 years later. [3] The appellant applied for a travel document to return to Canada in May 2006 which was refused because the appellant did not meet the residency obligation imposed upon him under subsection 28(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act). In order for a permanent resident to comply with their reside ncy obligation the permanent resident must with respect to a five-year period be physically present in Canada for at least 730 with respect to the five-year period. The appellant spent 47 days in Ca nada in 1996 before returning to India. In the five-year period immediately prior to his applyi ng for a travel document, the appellant did not spend any time residing in Canada. The appe llant appealed his residency obligation to the Immigration Appeal Division (Appeal Divisi on) who, on February 27, 2006, upon reviewing the documentation filed with respect to the appeal and upon having read the consent of the Minister filed, set aside the decision made outside Canada with respect to the appellant's residency obligation.

IAD File No. / N° de dossier de la SAI : VB5 -00997







REASONS FOR DECISION



[1] These are reasons and decisions of the Immigration Appeal Division (the “IAD”) in the

appeal by [REDACTED] (the “appellant”) for a determination made against her on February 2,

2015. The appellant was found to have failed to comply with the residency obligation

requirement under section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Act (the “ Act ”).1



BACKGROUND



[2] The appellant was under 18 years of age at the time of the determination and the filing of

the appeal with the IAD. Therefore, her father was appointed as a designated represen tative for

the appellant.



[3] The appellant and her father, [REDACTED], testified at the hearing. No additional

documentary evidence was submitted. Minister’s counsel provided written submissions dated

February 16, 2016.



ANALYSIS



[4] There was no challenge to the legal validity of the determination. The appellant has not

been in Canada at all in the relevant five year period from January 21, 2010 to January 20, 2015.

Based on the evidence before me, the appellant has n ot met the residency obligation

requirem ents under section 28 of the Act . Therefore the determination is valid in law.



[5] However, the IAD does have discretionary jurisdiction in these types of cases. The test to

be applied is: that the IAD must be satisfied at the time that the appeal is disposed of, taking into

account the best interests of a child directly affected by the decision, whether there are sufficient

humanitarian and compassionate considerations that warrant special relief in light of all the

considered by the IAD in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction.
