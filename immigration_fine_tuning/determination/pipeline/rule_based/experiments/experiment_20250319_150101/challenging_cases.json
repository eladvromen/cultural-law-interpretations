She\n\nbecame a permanent resident of Canada in 2012. After landing in Canada, the A ppellant stayed\n\nhere for about two months. She returned to Trinidad and Tobago to wrap up her affairs. Later, her\n\nparents became ill, which prevented her from retuning back to Canada sooner.\n\n[2] In 2020, the Appellant applied for a Permanent Resident Travel D ocument to return to\n\nCanada, but the visa officer refused her application. The Appellant did not respect her residency\n\nobligations to be present in Canada in the relevant five -year period for at least 730 days.1 In the\n\nrelevant five -year period, she was pr esent for only 136 days.\n\n[3] The Appellant appealed the visa officer\u2019s decision to the Immigration Appeal Division. She\n\nadmitted that the visa officer \u2019s decision is legally valid. She is relying on humanitarian and\n\ncompassionate reasons for the appeal to be allowed.\n\n[4] The Appellant\u2019s hearing was scheduled for three hours on June 18, 2021. I heard testimony\n\nfrom the Appellant, but we were not able to finish the hearing that day. I adjourned the matter for\n\nNovember 8, 2021, for a full day , to continue the hearing.\n\n[5] In a letter dated November 3, 2021, the Appellant asked to withdraw her appeal. The\n\nMinister submits that the withdrawal of the appeal is an abuse of process and asks that the appeal\n\nbe dismissed.2\n\n[6] The issues are:\n\n\uf0b7 Is the Appellan t\u2019s application to withdraw her appeal an abuse of process?\n\n\uf0b7 If I determine the withdrawal is an abuse of process , should the appeal be\n\ndismissed on its merits or abandoned ?\n\n[7] The Appellant\u2019s application to withdraw her appeal is an abuse of process. I dismi ss the\n\nAppellant\u2019s application. I find that the appeal has been..."

In fact, on the date of the decision at the port of entry, that is,\n\nNovember 12, 2015, the appellant had been present in Canada for approximately 30 days.\n\nFollowing the depart ure order, the tendency of being absent from Canada changed considerably,\n\nand he has spent most of his time in Canada since the order was issued in 2015. The appellant is\n\nnot challenging the legal validity of the decision. He is requesting that the panel consider the\n\nvarious humanitarian and comp assionate considerations in his case.\n\n\n\n[2] Considering the appellant\u2019s position and the evidence in the case, the panel concludes\n\nthat the officer\u2019s decision is valid in law.

The Appellants are all citizens\n\nof Vietnam and permanent residents of Canada.\n\n[2] Permanent residents of Canada have a residency obligation. One of the ways to comply\n\nwith this obligation is to spend a certain number of days in C anada.\n\n[3] The Appellants are all in Vietnam. Their permanent resident cards are expired. Therefore,\n\nthey each applied for a permanent resident travel document. Their applications were all received\n\non June 18, 2020.\n\n[4] An immigration officer refused the Appellants\u2019 applications. The officer found that they\n\nhad not complied with their residency obligation. The officer also found that there were not\n\nsufficient humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) considerations to overcome the lack of\n\ncompliance. The Appell ants are appealing the officer\u2019s decision.1\n\n[5] The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance of probabilities. This means what is\n\nmore probable than not.\n\n[6] The appeals are allowed. The A ppellants did not comply with their residency obligation.\n\nHowever, I conclude that there are enough H&C considerations to overcome their non -\n\ncompliance.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe Appellants did not comply with their residency obligation\n\n[7] The Appellants became permanent residents in 2014. They needed to be physically\n\npresent in Canada fo r a total of at least 730 days over a five -year period.2 In this case, the\n\nrelevant five -year period is from June 18, 2015, to June 18, 2020.

The Principal Appellant, Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , and [REDACTED] are Nigerian\n\ncitizens. [REDACTED] was born in the United States and is therefore an American citizen. The\n\nAppellants fear political persecution in Nigeria due to the Principal Appellant\u2019s involvement i n\n\nthe All Progressives Congress (\u201cAPC\u201d) . The Appellants fear that members of the People\u2019 s\n\nDemocratic Party (\u201cPDP\u201d) will seek to harm them . The Refugee Protection Division (\u201cRPD\u201d)\n\nrejected the Appella nts\u2019 claims . The RPD identified problems with the credibility of the Principal\n\nAppellant\u2019s testimony. The panel appeared to accept the facts around the Principal Appellant\u2019s\n\npolitical activities , but it determined that there was a viable internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) in\n\nAbuja. The Appellants dispute this decision and provide new evidence that addresses the RPD\u2019s\n\nfindings.\n\n[2] The result of this appeal is a split decision . A claim against the United Sta tes was not\n\nadvanced for [REDACTED] at the RPD, nor have the Appellants disputed the RPD\u2019s reasons for\n\nrejecting her claim. No risks have been identified for [REDACTED] in the United States that would\n\nentitle her to refugee protection . The Refugee Appeal Division (\u201cRAD\u201d) therefore a gree s with\n\nthe RPD\u2019s reasons for rejecting her claim.

Given the ties they stil l had to Iran, the appellants return ed in order\n\nto wind up their affairs , and to prepare for a late r stage of their life and retirement. Such is the\n\nreason for their departure from Canada .\n\n[5] The reason the appellants extended their stay abroad was because Mr. [REDACTED] \u2019s father\n\nhad heart problems in 2011 , and suffered from a stroke .

The appellant\u2019s wife is here in the room with us. Facts [3] The facts of this matter can be summarized as follows. Mr. [REDACTED] is a permanent resident of Canada, of Palestinian origin, and is therefore stat eless. There is no country of citizenship. Before coming to Canada, he lived in Dubai, a nation whic h does not confer status on foreign nationals who worked in that country. Mr. [REDACTED] is an engineer by profession and his professional contracts were in Dubai. When he came to Canada, it was made clear to him that he would require two years of university training to receive the Canadian equiva lencies in his profession.

They are appealing the de termination by the Minister\u2019s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA\n\n, because the Minister\u2019s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA\n\n.

His wife and three children were to follow him to Canada. [2] The appellant returned to India in January 1997 because of his wife's ill health. He submitted his Indian passport and his immigration vi sa (assumedly his record of landing) to the immigration section of the Canadian High Comm ission in New Delhi, India in January 1997 for the purpose of obtaining a returning resident's permit under the provisions of the former Immigration Act. His visa and passport were lost or stol en at either the New Delhi visa office or in the mail. The appellant's request for a re turning resident permit was not granted. The appellant's passport and visa were returned to him by the visa office 10 years later. [3] The appellant applied for a travel document to return to Canada in May 2006 which was refused because the appellant did not meet the residency obligation imposed upon him under subsection 28(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act). In order for a permanent resident to comply with their reside ncy obligation the permanent resident must with respect to a five-year period be physically present in Canada for at least 730 with respect to the five-year period. The appellant spent 47 days in Ca nada in 1996 before returning to India. In the five-year period immediately prior to his applyi ng for a travel document, the appellant did not spend any time residing in Canada. The appe llant appealed his residency obligation to the Immigration Appeal Division (Appeal Divisi on) who, on February 27, 2006, upon reviewing the documentation filed with respect to the appeal and upon having read the consent of the Minister filed, set aside the decision made outside Canada with respect to the appellant's residency obligation.
