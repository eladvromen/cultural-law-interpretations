REASONS FOR DECISION

Introduction [1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal, pursuant to subsection 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

(IRPA ) of T[REDACTED] (the principal appellant), his wife, [REDACTED] (the appellant) and E[REDACTED] (the minor appellant). They are appealing the de termination by the Minister’s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA

, because the Minister’s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA

. [2] Specifically, the appellants had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five- year period immediately after they became permanent residents, which was on March 27, 2003. The Minister’s Delegate was also not sati sfied, pursuant to section 28(2)(c) of IRPA

, that there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate c onsiderations, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the determination, to justify retention of permanent resident status and overcome the breach of the residency obligations. Background



[3] The principal appellant is 44 years old. He was born on July 18, 1963 in Kuwait, but he is a citizen of Lebanon. His wife is 38 years old and a citizen of Lebanon. His son, E[REDACTED], is 9 years old and a citizen of Le banon. There is a second son, [REDACTED], who is 7 years old. He is not an appellant in this appeal. [4] The family came to Canada as permanent re sidents on March 27, 2003. They left Canada and returned to Kuwait on April 12, 2003, when the principal appellant’s wife became ill in Canada with bronchial asthma. The principal appellant returned on March 2, 2006 and remained

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (the claimant) is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Communist regime and in particular, the Public Security Bureau, by reason of his political opinion as a Falun Gong practitioner.

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , (the principal claimant), [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , (the female

claimant), and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , (minor claimant), seek protection in Canada pursuant to

sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 They allege a

well -founded fear of persecution in Pakistan from Tehrik -i-Taliban.

[2] Pursuant to Rule 55(1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules,2 these claims have been

membership in a particular social group are outside their country of nationality and are unable,

by reason of that fear, or are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that county”,

namely Pakistan. In the alternative, they allege they are persons in need of protection. Their fear

stems from the attempts of Tehrik -i-Taliban (Taliban) to recruit the principal claimant. A

summary of their allegations f ollows:

[REDACTED] , which is in the Khyber -Pakhtunkhwa (KP) region of Pakistan.

certain “checkpoint”. When he failed to show up, three men went to the

family home to look for him. His father advised him to go into hiding,

which he did. He principal claimant went to the village of [REDACTED] , where

he foun d work as a [REDACTED] . He lost his job when men came ...</div>

REASONS FOR DECISION



INTRODUCTION



[1] The Appellant Minister appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD),

dated June 22, 2018 , accepting the claim for refugee protection of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

(the Respondent ) who is a citizen of Honduras .



[2] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirm s the decision of the RPD that the A ppellant is

a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection

Act (IRPA).1



[3] The determinative issues in this appeal are whether the RPD erred in its credibility

assessment and section 97 analysis regarding risk.



OVERVIEW OF APPEAL



[4] The Respondent is a 45 -year -old female from Honduras. The Respondent and her family

have been targeted by a criminal gang in Honduras over a several year period. She fears that if

she returns to her country, she will be again extorted by criminal gangs and that she will be

perceived as someone who has money or could get money. Since she will not be able to make

extortion payments she fears that she will be killed or her children will be kidnapped to force her

to make payments as has occurred with at least one family member in the past.



The RPD Finding



[5] The RPD found the Respondent to be a credible witness who testified in a straightforward

manner. The RPD also found that the Respondent and her fa mily had been targeted over a long

period of time by a criminal gang and that her half -brother was murdered by the gang as a

message to the family in regard to the payment of an extortion or war tax. The RPD found the

REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (a.k.a. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , the principal Appellant) and her

minor daughters [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (a.k.a. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] ) and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (a.k.a. [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] ), the minor Appellants , citizens of Nigeria, appeal a decision of the Refugee

Protection Division (RPD) denying their claims for refugee protection. The principal Appellant

has agreed to act as the D esignated Representative for her minor daughters with respect to thei r

claims. They have not submitted any new evidence in support of their claims but have requested

an oral hearing. The Appellants request that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the

determination of the RPD and find that they are Convention refugee s or persons in need of

protection or, in the alternative, to refer the matter back to the RPD.

DETERMINATION

[2] Pursuant to sub section 111(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),

the RAD refers the principal Appellant’s claim back to the RPD for re -determination. The

principal Appellant’s appeal is allowed.

[3] Pursuant to sub section 11 1(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the determination of the

RPD regarding the minor Appellant s’ claims. These appeals are dismissed.

BACKGROUND

[4] The principal Appellant alleged before the RPD that she fears for her safety on the basis of

her sexual orientation if she has to return to her home country of Nigeria. She claims that she is a

bisexual woman. She also alleges that her childr en may be impacted as a result by possibly being

removed from her custody, and also alleges that there is a possibility that she and/or her children

may be subject to female genital mutilation (FGM) if they return to Nigeria.

REASONS FOR DECISION

OVERVIEW

[1] The Appellants are [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“the Principal Appellant ”), his wife

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] ”), their minor son [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] (“[REDACTED] ”), and their minor daughter [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

(“[REDACTED] ”). The Principal Appellant, Ms. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] , and [REDACTED] are Nigerian

citizens. [REDACTED] was born in the United States and is therefore an American citizen. The

Appellants fear political persecution in Nigeria due to the Principal Appellant’s involvement i n

the All Progressives Congress (“APC”) . The Appellants fear that members of the People’ s

Democratic Party (“PDP”) will seek to harm them . The Refugee Protection Division (“RPD”)

rejected the Appella nts’ claims . The RPD identified problems with the credibility of the Principal

Appellant’s testimony. The panel appeared to accept the facts around the Principal Appellant’s

political activities , but it determined that there was a viable internal flight alternative (“IFA”) in

Abuja. The Appellants dispute this decision and provide new evidence that addresses the RPD’s

findings.

[2] The result of this appeal is a split decision . A claim against the United Sta tes was not

advanced for [REDACTED] at the RPD, nor have the Appellants disputed the RPD’s reasons for

rejecting her claim. No risks have been identified for [REDACTED] in the United States that would

entitle her to refugee protection . The Refugee Appeal Division (“RAD”) therefore a gree s with

the RPD’s reasons for rejecting her claim. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)( a) of the Immigration

and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”), the appeal in regard to [REDACTED] claim is dismissed.

[1] The claimants state that they are citizens of Swaziland and claim refugee protection in

accordance with sections 96 to 99 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act . [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

[REDACTED] is also a citizen of South Africa.

[2] The claimants constitute a family. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] is the mother of two minor

[5] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] husband and the father of the two minor claimants, [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] , is [REDACTED] was a member of the People ’s United Democratic Movement

(PUDEMO ). Authorities attempted to arrest him after a bridge was bombed in [REDACTED] 2009, but

were unable to do so because he fled to South Africa. In their attempt to locate him, police began

to harass and question the claimants. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] was detained for questioning on a

number of occasions and assaulted. In [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] 2010 her house was also searched and

she was again taken in for questioning. After release she went to live with her sister at [REDACTED] in

ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION

[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the appeal s of [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] (the appellants) , who appeal ed from a determin ation that they breached the

residency obligation.

ISSUE

[2] The five -year period under consideration is from July 5, 2010 to July 5, 2015. The parties

agreed that the appellants were in the country for only 249 days during the five -year period. This

is only 34 percent compliance. The visa officer’s determination is legally valid . T he appellants

are asking f or special relief on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds.

HUMANITARIAN AND COMPASSIONATE GROUNDS

[3] I heard testimony from the appellant , Mr. [REDACTED] . Based on the testimony, the Minister’s

counsel recommended the appeal s be allowed for the reasons that follows .

[4] Mr. [REDACTED] and his wife landed in July , 2009. We heard testimony that the appellants

returned to Iran because Mr. [REDACTED] had not yet retired from his job , and their second son was in

university in Iran at the time . Given the ties they stil l had to Iran, the appellants return ed in order

to wind up their affairs , and to prepare for a late r stage of their life and retirement. Such is the

reason for their departure from Canada .

[5] The reason the appellants extended their stay abroad was because Mr. [REDACTED] ’s father

had heart problems in 2011 , and suffered from a stroke . Since Mr. [REDACTED] was a medical doctor,

he remained in Iran to take care of his father , as he felt that he was in the best position to do so ,

given his training as a medical doctor.

[6] Mr. [REDACTED] has a brother and three sisters in Teheran ; since his father is now recovered,

he testified that his siblings are able to assume the responsibility of the care of their father. The

Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection. The Appellant asks

Reasons for Decision

Introduction and Issue [1] These are three appeals pursu ant to section 63(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

1 (IRPA) of departure orders based on IRPA section 41(b) made against each of the three appellants. The appellants are a mother

2 (“appellant mother”) and her two daughters ([REDACTED],

3 “eldest appellant daughter”; and [REDACTED] “youngest appellant daughter”). [2] The appellants do not contest the validity of the departure orders and the issue is whether the appellants have proven that there are gr ounds to warrant special relief, pursuant to IRPA section 67(c). Decision [3] Having considered the evidence and submissi ons, and especially the submissions of the respondent, the panel finds that the departure orders are valid in law. The panel finds that the three appellants have proven on a balance of pr obabilities that their appeals warrant special relief. The three appeals are allowed.
