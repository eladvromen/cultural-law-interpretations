They are appealing the de termination by the Minister\u2019s Delegate, made on September 27, 2006, to issue a departure orders against them as a persons described in subsection 41(b) of IRPA\n\n, because the Minister\u2019s Delegate was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, there were grounds to believe that the appellants were permanent residents who were inadmissible to Canada for failing to comp ly with the residency obligation contained in section 28 of IRPA\n\n. [2] Specifically, the appellants had failed to reside in Canada for at least 730 days in the five- year period immediately after they became permanent residents, which was on March 27, 2003. The Minister\u2019s Delegate was also not sati sfied, pursuant to section 28(2)(c) of IRPA\n\n, that there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate c onsiderations, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the determination, to justify retention of permanent resident status and overcome the breach of the residency obligations. Background\n\n\n\n[3] The principal appellant is 44 years old. He was born on July 18, 1963 in Kuwait, but he is a citizen of Lebanon. His wife is 38 years old and a citizen of Lebanon. His son, E[REDACTED], is 9 years old and a citizen of Le banon. There is a second son, [REDACTED], who is 7 years old. He is not an appellant in this appeal. [4] The family came to Canada as permanent re sidents on March 27, 2003. They left Canada and returned to Kuwait on April 12, 2003, when the principal appellant\u2019s wife became ill in Canada with bronchial asthma.
