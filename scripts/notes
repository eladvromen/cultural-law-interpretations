TODO
## determination extraction-

### schedule:
#### Tuseday
start building spesific sentence rule based extractions.
utulize knowledge from train of explicit sentences. 

#### Wednesday 
- need to add decopmosed explicit determination extraction. 
- need to add rule based post tuning
#### Thursday
- need to decsied on the exact preprocessing approach. I think that the low recall high prescion will be used as benchmark and for text that is not in the extracted sections. than more neuanced methods will be used.
 - wrapp up rule based.
 - create benchmark eval for performances. 
 - decsied what are the train\validation\test splits. 
 - wrap rule based code nicely. 

### further plans
- look for open source solution
- start with simple methodes
   - move to NN methodes - legal BERT? 
- move to payed API from SOTA models
- create manual benchmark...

### NOTES TO THINK OF
- there are 2 types of cases- first and re appeals which have some differences in structure.
-need to add metadata from enroched(include descion label) to processed. maybe merge later

### DONE
1. need to understand exactly the differences between full text and all sentense and decide which one we will use.
- if we want legal reasoning, full text is crucial. 
2. understand what to do with the duplicated desionID by year and how to distinct them -
